Maybe AI is just a fad like cryptos.,
Steve Jobs would have made a new iPhone that truly utilizes AI.,
"Hey man. I'd like to present you a subject that I am very anxious about. Why can't we remove our phone batteries now? This is not only about right to repair but rather right to self privacy. I know our phones track us all day and every hour. This is utterly unacceptable. Even If I turn my phone off I can see where it is on my device. That is alright if the device is stolen but my iphone 15 pro max was stolen and my government (TÃ¼rkiye) did absolutely nothing so far so fk that. I want real true privacy, I want to be able to remove my battery when I go to bed. Why all these mega tech companies pushing us glue? I want the old existing click design, a back cover and a removable battery, not only for the right to repair but for my very own privacy. Otherwise eventually these tech giants will listen to everything we do, and perhaps they'll have magnetic sensors that read magnetic fields to even read our minds, this is not crazy, it is reality and it may already be happenning. I just want to be easily remove the battery of the fking phone I own. Is that too much? If you think so, you're doomed.",
"They try to cover up their incompetence with liquid glass mess lol ðŸ¤£Apple is dead and soon youtube will be be filled with videos of ""Rise and downfall of Apple"" or ""Apple declared bankruptcy""",

Apple is a design company,
Chat GPT sucks too... I just decided to cancel my subscription this mth. Gemini is much better with language tasks for now.,

World of A.I Is filled with a bunch of deepfakes,
Repeat after me- iPhones are value for money only when you buy  a device from three generations before,
good,
Dagogo is a king,
Apple has been making lackluster copy and paste products for the last 10 years straight! Hopefully their dominance is coming to an end bc they havenâ€™t been creative since Steve Jobs died.,
I CAN'T wait for this bubble to pop!!! It's mostly absurd!,

"Apple markets themselves as a creative company, making tools for creative workflows. Iâ€™m not too surprised they struggle with AI.. Many people in creative fields tend to dismiss or downright despise AIâ€™s encroachment on the integrity of the creative process.",
I'll give them one more year. If everything does not work as perfectly as back in the day I'm switching away.,
"I understand the claim perfectly. However, it is still unclearâ€¦ Apple didnâ€™t make their own chips for a long time. They still donâ€™t make many of the components in their interfaces (devices). Sam Altman made the point that even for Open AI, given that capable models will become ubiquitous, it no longer makes sense to build the TOP AI, it is smarter to focus on the human/AI interface. And this is where Apple sits. The future is unanticipateable. There is good reason to think that this â€œfailureâ€ is temporary, and may be more forward looking than it seems.",
"This video sounds like its narrated by AI.
Listen to the bizarre pronounciation of ""advertisements"" at 4:25",
bro said rare apple LðŸ˜‚,
We're seeing the fall of Apple.  It's internal problems are too great.,
What did tim cook do?? Talk about leadership,
14:03  Who tf is the technician that tought is a good idea to replace a FPC connector inside the frame with the battery ???,
"I kid you not, I paused the video and asked Apple Intelligence if I have any upcoming flights (Iâ€™m flying to Georgia tomorrow) just to test it out and it literally said it couldnâ€™t find anything and to check my mail for reservations like isnâ€™t that basic stuff google can do? Itâ€™s really disappointing tbh",
The fundamental problem is Tim Cook. Two reasons. 1) Heâ€™s not a product visionary. He didnâ€™t know how to see the vision of Siri the way Steve Jobs had. 2) Tim let senior management division and disfunction around AI/ML fester for far too long.,
"I am seriously thinking of leaving the Apple ecosystem bc of this.  It is one thing not wanting to use a feature, but to not have it on devices that are this expensive is unacceptable to say the least.  The liquid glass thing is a crock, a UI gimmick to offset incompetence.",
"The fact that they branded it as â€œApple Intelligenceâ€ a gimmicky play on AI ,is already misleading. Itâ€™s designed to make less tech-savvy users believe â€œApple Intelligenceâ€ is something unique or revolutionary, when in reality, itâ€™s just rebranded tech jargon and marketing fluff.",
"I been using Apple iPhone & MacBook Pro for many years. I have two serious issues that bug me with Apple. With Apple Intelligence I use it just for proofreading.  I find I can only do few paragraphs at a time, otherwise it all crashes and messes up my text. With email it changes the font when sending and the recipient gets odd looking email that looks like cut and paste.",
bro just buy open ai,
"I gave a dislike because of the awful AI comics used, otherwise good video, dont use trash AI image generation",
"The unexamined assumption in this video is that people actually want this shit.    If Apple hasnâ€™t produced what people donâ€™t really want yet, big deal.",
Wow that Gemini demonstration was impressive.,
"Just like Nokia had it's downfall, Apple's day will come too. It's only a matter of time.",
16:27 how is glass supposed to detract from anything. Itâ€™s pointless,
Itâ€™s neither a â€œdisasterâ€ nor a â€œfailure.â€ But these words sure grab oneâ€™s attention.,
Apple is dead. And thatâ€™s a good thing.,
"Broken team, broken progress!",
"Why are they trying to reinvent the wheel, why not just integrate with one of these AI Open source software?",
You left out the threats from China on Apple - AI would prevent China from collecting all data and ability to censor and control what information the people of china could have access to.  WHY ....   btw Apple is opening a factory in the US.   This video didn't age well.  Oh and Samsung just lost BILLIONS of dollars.,

"This isn't looking good for Tim Cook. He's tarnishing his legacy by missing a huge turning point. As for what Apple can do better: Change. Give up on your pretentious privacy ambitions. Embrace being a software company like Google, OpenAI, or any other numerous bay area firms. Else, having missed AI, Apple will be history.",
"Very good video, So true everything. But whats the song at the beginning in the background?? :)",
"not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. broâ€¦ this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now.",
"If youâ€™ve been wondering why youâ€™re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If youâ€™re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak",
"I felt so drained and tired everday. I tried everything, preworkouts, youtube gurus, morning routines that nearly killed me. none of it hit. then i saw someone mention Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in the comments and it literally changed my life. Following everything in that book past couple of weeks made me realize I was running on empty for YEARS. wish I knew about this years agoðŸ”¥",
"if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man. chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. no hype bs, not fake motivation just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this book really saved me. wish I found it sooner.ðŸ”¥",
Siri is useless lol,
Rare ???,
So they pulled an Elon Musk/Tesla,
Gross pun. ðŸ˜¤,
The entire video sounds like none of the WWDC24 announced AI features were released ðŸ™ƒ,
What is the song at the end of the video anyone?,
"""I'm Sorry Gavin, It's Apple maps bad""

""FUUUUUUU.....""",
Apple intelligence shouldâ€™ve been released 2 years later,
3:55 Steve Jobs wouldâ€™ve made that possible,
"I just got a new iPhone and it sucks at orienting the screen horizontally. Most of the time when I turn my phone landscape it will full screen upside down, so I rotate my phone 180Â° only for the picture to then â€œcorrectâ€ and also rotate 180Â°, rendering it upside down again.",
"( 2:49 ) I did not appreciate you implying that my baby blue iPhone XR is a fragmented piece of trash ðŸ˜¡! Lol, after 7+ years it kind of is a slow and buggy piece of ðŸ¤¬",
I swear to God that Siri is still remain unchanged since I had my first Appleâ€™s product in 2015,
"Glad this is a ""rare failure"" because if the same thing happens in Microsoft software for example, nobody is surprised because frankly this sort of poorly though-out spray-on feature shipping is everyday stuff for MS. Apple has a pretty decent track record for feature delivery, but this is by a wide margin the biggest flop I think I've seen them have since the Newton or iOS 7.",
"I bought my first iPhone a few months ago, and for the most part I like it, but itâ€™s so dumb in some basic things compared to Samsung phones, like asking it to set an alarm and it gets the time wrong if you donâ€™t say it exactly how it expects, or the fact that Siri never answers anything, just offers me links to Safari, feels so amateur",
Youâ€™re making a lot of claims without citing sources. Itâ€™s been a while since i saw your video. Still trashy,
Is Apple Intelligence an oxymoron?,
"Good short documentary. 

I enjoyed listening to your points. As always only being informative and not giving any of your own thoughts. ðŸ’­ 

Thank you Dagogo. ðŸ˜Š",
Giving AI ownership to the head of Vision Pro tells me everything I need to know about the future of AI at Apple. Shorting their stock now.,
"Its not just Apple. Google, Tesla, Meta: They have all overpromised and underdelivered for close to 2 years now (many more in the case of Musk) in terms of ""AI"". I personally bought a Pixel 8 from Google for example, and to this date it cannot do what their demos have been showing since the whole AI hype started. Never getting a Pixel again... $150 Chinese phones deliver 80% of new Apple and Google phones.",
"What I find strange is that Apple added a chip in the 80's to be able to use LISP modules for the eraly AI computers.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sV7C6Ezl35A",
Tim cook is a disaster for apple. They are staying up simply by inertia now. Apple silicon is amazing but the rest of the company is a disaster. Instead of focusing on innovation they are doubling down on the worst parts of their walled garden customer hostile policies.,
"The core issue that is missed out is that APPLE worked for decades, more so after Steve, with communist repressive regimes more than any of its competitors wiping out their innovation but worse we do not know even if there is multiple back doors built by the CCP manufacturing provided parts WHICH MIGHT BE CAUSING UNSEEN before CRASHES.",
"I feel like the only 3 things that Apple needs to fix with Apple Intelligence are:
1. FIX SIRI
2. ADD SUPPORT FOR MORE LANGUAGES
3. FIX PHOTO CLEANUP(Galaxy AI has this feature where if you erase something in front of an object, it will refill the object behind; APPLE NEEDS IT)",
"A little over 4 years ago, Apple Silicon changed the laptop industry in a major way. Apple did such things several times. Apple underestimated AI, but it's hardly time to starting saying it's all over.",
Go wokeâ€¦â€¦,
Windows Vista,
Time for a new CEO.  Tim is Cooked.,
"Apple software has lots of bugs that seem obvious, like when they removed the search function for MP3's (or equivalent) files in your music library.  Months later they put it back.",
Standard apple products = a showbag ( flash on the outside and full of shit on the inside ),
"The simple fact is that a company follows its CEO. Not the other way around. Jobs was a futurist. He was okay with sacrificing â€œme tooâ€ features for an overall special product. 

But now, we have Tim Cook. Cook is a supply chain guy. Great at mass production, okay at leadership, following Jobsâ€™ marketing language. 

But now heâ€™s running out of shit to do and since he isnâ€™t an innovator at heart, he is seriously making Apple fall far behind. 

I think Jobsâ€™ biggest mistake was telling Cook, â€œDonâ€™t ask yourself what I would doâ€",
"Dude. Idk why, but every single time I open YouTube on my Apple TV this video auto plays. Even after a couple hours of YouTube after work, every single day, the next time I open it, itâ€™s the first video it opens. Itâ€™s been 4 days now ðŸ˜‚",
"Apple will forever be a top company no matter what. People buy it more as a status symbol rather than ""ai features"".",
"Apple is cooked, they canâ€™t catch upâ€¦",
Siri is so worthless. When you ask it something it gives you a web search.,
"So much for ""closed source""",
"0:38
â€œI canâ€™t believe this is iOSâ€
Really? Whatâ€™s so special about the homescreen? Itâ€™s just a software update that requires no innovation in the R&D. Many other brands have done that and here we are, brainless fanboy/fangirl praising Apple just because it change its UI like a cult.",
You summed it up perfectly at the end: Apple is losing its direction.,
"Apple started caring more about money and less about innovation, this will hit them hard if they donâ€™t lock in. 1200 for an android is looking a lot better nowadays and Iâ€™ve always been an IPhone guy and after RCS itâ€™s like ehh",
"Transparency is needed here. Like with ads I would really like to see how many people actually do use AI, there seems to be a big disparity here.",
"I want Apple to fail even more.

Removed free wired earbuds
Sold a solution with airpods
Removed headphone jack
Removed free charger
Always behind two generations in tech
Always sold at an ridiculously inflated price

Great video but 30s of unskippable ads every 3 minutes? Really?,
"Again, when a company only cares its EPS, it will become what it wants to be... Apple and Boeing",
Siri is bizarrely worthless these days.,
Apple intelligence => Sheep intelligence,
"Nobody actually cares about AI, hardly anybody uses it other than trying or some entertainment at first few days then it is left.",
"DEI Hires can destroy a company.  B players cant hire A players and it snowballs.

Apple going woke is the reason.  I have my box of popcorn and enjoying the show.",Nah they havnâ€™t innovated since Steve Jobs died

At this point the best feature shown at wwdcs are the fancy transitions and animations the marketing team can pull off,
"Well, not really, they are moving, some interesting research papers are undergoing. They are moving slowly, but they will be there someday, but yeah, they don't have own LLM and i suppose might never be...",
"Iâ€™m leaving iPhone soon and eventually all Apple products. I genuinely feel like my productivity is much lower than my friend who uses Android and Windows, even though Iâ€™m paying more for Apple products. Apple tries to make their products simple by vanishing or hiding important functionality which make no sense. How does that help users?

Look at Samsung, look at google, how they are making their phone intuitive and productive",

Apple died with Steve Jobs. Over the years I've sold all of my Apple products and don't see a time in the near future when I will return as a customer to Apple. This video just put context to my journey as a consumer.,

Rare Apple failure? Nothing Apple has ever done has worked as advertised.,
Apple's walled garden is starting to look like a prison for their users. A prison who's walls are slightly weaker now that they're forced to use USB-C.,
Samsung phones have been superior for years,

I love how premium the content of this channels plays.,
"Apple should just sit this one out completely and improve on the bugs within their past and present softwares. Admit defeat and move on, unless you can find an artificial intelligence that can actually give you future projections that can generate money. Otherwise, fall back.",
"10:30 and also stealing your personal data, because apple cares about privacy and none of people who used Siri agreed to share their voice recordings for improvement of speech recognition and performance, therefore its way behind. Because when you use google assistant or Alexa they gather voice recordings regardless of your consent for it, your data is basically available everywhere if you know where to look",
"Apple at its core and from the top down of the company is EXTREMELY WOKE. Horribly infected with the toxic mind virus. Discriminatory DEI policies often lead to collapse companies like a domino effect. Also I know several engineers at Apple that do NOTHING, if you thought Twitter was bad, Apple is worse, far worse. 

If Android wasnâ€™t riddled with viruses and shady apps and laggy Ui and terrible quality, I would have switched long ago. Apple is definitely running on borrowed time and like a ship very slowly sinking beneath the waves. Hopefully Tesla will enter into the mobile market soon ;)",
What's the Burn Water track at the beginning of the video?,
Hiring Indian nationals was the beginning of the end,
It is all happening because Apple rejected my job application.,
"If false marketing is a crime, Tesla would be the biggest offender",
_laughing in Samsung_,

A rare failure? Apple has had many failures in its history...,
This has to be one of the best ColdFusion intros,
"Thank god someone is saying it, I thought I was imaginging things - I dont particulalarly like Apple but im doing my PhD in computer science and felt I should get some experience with all the ecosystems and got myself a new iPhone... it wasnt a great experience the user experience  felt off, apps were slow, the keyboard wasnt responsive, bluetooth dropped randomly - not good for a new phone.",
Lack of strong leadership.,
A rare failure??? I don't think so,
"It's because apple worked years on ui ux, not on real software and algorithms. They know how to package things, not to make things",
But it is great that they are not shipping AI bloatware.,
Great gemini features i want aware about will use it,
"Apple's 'good enough' software development blundering since 2016, by my account, has not made the failure of ""Apple Intelligence"" a rare event. It's an inevitability. It's beyond time for Apple to clean house and bring in new talent that understands and lives by ""Insanely Great"", and are not into spoon-feeding the stockholder children. Not kidding. This ballooning Apple software blundering is making them out to be fools. That's bad for the entire software industry and users. Very bad.",
Apple values your privacy thatâ€™s why Siri and Apple intelligence isnâ€™t as good as itâ€™s competitors. These things require your data to improve the model.,
Apple is going to be having a lot more failures in the near future. Their products are total piles of shit compared to how great the used to be.,
Android also had a disastrous plunge in usability. Absolutely arduous to use. Dictation is absolutely HORRIBLE as is grammar correction in general.,
"Companies should be required to demonstrate working prototypes and functional finished products, not performances showcasing hypotheticals that they hope/expect to someday accomplish.",
"Apple Intelligence would require vision and an experimental culture, both of which Apple lacks. Complete inability to innovate or adapt.",

LLMs wont deliver the dream nor the nightmare of Skynet. It seems that so many smart people are hallucinating like LLMs do.  Apple may be right to step back.",
i think generative goes agaist Apple's grain because of their obsession with user experience: generative is just way too unpredictable even though it's the best AI we have,
Honestly after testing iOS 26 I feel like Iâ€™m finally putting in the towel on my time with Apple products.,

"Apple software was best and easiest, but now they hardly have any of those useful and utilitarian AI tools, like object eraser(not available everywhere), circle to search and many more.

"Thanks to Apple they DID invent a new urban slang - if something is Apple Intelligent that means it has nothing on a box of hammers.  Hubris and myopia has Apple losing the tech Plot. Apple has been sliding by with iOS and permutations of that - the Phone, the Watch, Carplay etc. Who remembers Titan the Apple car?? Seems they bailed and lost hundreds of millions on that fantasy too. Apple couldn't even make an EV Apple Bike. Apple lost their imagination going into things other legacy had been already doing - credit cards etc - big zzzzzzz.

"People keep forgetting Apple is a luxury designer brand first, tech company second. It doesn't matter how bad their quality is so long as people think it's luxury",
Apple is being dragged down by DEI.  Itâ€™s not their only problem but it has been a big one.,
"Honestly I don't disagree with Apple's execs. LLM products are all cool novelties, but for all the money they are still just not that useful for your average consumer. I dont want to talk to my phone to ask questions about things in front of me or have it draft soulless email replies. Object eraser and live translate- while better on Android- are neat gimmicks not worth all the breathless enthusiasm from these companies.",

Now, ISP CEOs are cyber-scamming and cyberbullying and cyber mugging the taxpayers while regulators and watchdogs are dining and yachting with these criminals ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®",
Apple's software have always been bad. The only part that is good is their UI,

"Giannandrea is an Italian-originated surname. It's essentially composed of two names: Gian and Andrea, both Italian male names. Therefore, uniting these two names you get the Giannandrea surname. (I know his surname is not the focus of this video, but I felt like clarifying it for everyone)",
Itâ€™s better to wait and make better more informed business decisions than to rush into a hype bubble thatâ€™s about to burst. Guess in the end they succumbed to the classic stakeholder pressure.,

In all honesty I bought a used s21 plus it's used device and I am surprised how android has actually unleashed the true innovation while Apple is just gimmicky i have been apple user since iphone 4 launch but now i have to admit Apple is fooling us around.,
Apple last major innovation was the M1 platform. Nothing since then.,
"They had Siri first, Jobs saw something in it. Where is it today?",
Nothing fascinates me more than seeing Apple failing and their deception being exposed.,

I can tell you with 100% certainty that the reason they stopped Apple Server was because they were incompetent and had no knowledge of actual servers. For like two years their default xserve config was an open relay, its fucking laughable. First iPhone no copy paste, like what the fuck. They've always been garbage, right from the start. Dumb people fall for the propaganda, and it amazes me how many there are. They think apple's bugs are a normal thing because they've used nothing else for years.",
Thereâ€™s something untrustworthy and almost sleazy car salesman about Craig Federighi. I canâ€™t shake the vibe.,
Perhaps Iâ€™m speaking for myself but I NEVER thought apple intelligence would be anything but a total gimmick â€¦ chat gpt is the best thing AI has given us and itâ€™s nothing more than google 2.0,
What was up with the music in the beginning. Vocals in the same volumen range as the people in the voice exerpts. Its a minor thing really good vid.,
"But Apple matters less in other parts of the world. Two reasons: Apple doesn't have any 'free' services like Google e.g Maps, Youtube, Gmail, etc. and that brings me to second reason: most people elsewhere can't stand a closed ecosystem (and also quite expensive one at that). No wonder Apple matters little in most parts of the world. Is Apple good enough then? Probably yes. But is also quite a terrible company.",
Been saying this for years. Apple has become a marketing company instead of a great product company it once was...,
They have 2 yrs to sort this out â€¦after that the AI train will go far ahead and they would not be able to catch up no matter how much money and effort they giveâ€¦,
The number of apple ads I saw in the last few days sitting in India shows the desperation. No smart spender will buy an apple in India.,
Itâ€™s the me me me era. Look whatâ€™s happening to Boing. Sad. We are doing it to ourselves.,
Apple is doing a Nokia when they refused to embrace the touch screens.,
Steve Jobs is must be rolling in his grave over how badly his company has been mismanaged by a neverending parade of idiots. Apple only ever thrived when he was running it.,

While generally Apple has done a better job listening to users, their slide into mediocrity started in 2020 when it seemed engineers were moving buttons around or adding useless ""features"" to iOS, OSX, etc. in more of an attempt to justify their job for another programming sprint rather than add something useful to the product.",
"People should realize, AI is not something that you design outright like classical programming. It requires fresh new minds, experience handling the data and understanding the AI model design, and good data. Experience from only the head of the AI division is not going to be enough to lead you to a great model. Itâ€™s the people who deal with the data and are hands on with the model are going to know it best. Unless those heads get crazy hands on wet the model themselves. At the current stage, AI is still pretty experimental and janky, but theyâ€™re ever so slightly taking strides at getting better and better even so. Appleâ€™s very philosophy of making the best when itâ€™s will established is the very antithesis of that mentality. So until Apple gets a bit more experimental, theyâ€™re going to be highly behind for a while",
apple has always sucked. it's only successful because of its lemming customers,
"Iâ€™m not trying to defend Apple, itâ€™s a corporation and wonâ€™t benefit from me defending it, but we gotta be a bit consistent with this narrative, we canâ€™t be complaining that â€œcompanies are stealing our data AI modelsâ€ and then ridicule Apple for not stealing user data to train its AI, itâ€™s hypocritical.",

In Apples case this was probably more a matter of dysfunction than strategy though.",

"I wouldn't call it a rare failure. It's a rare instance where Apple's failures can't be ignored, recontexualized, or reframed as a setup for a future victory.

This failure in AI is right in line with the failure of the Vision Pro, and right in line with the failure of the iPhone Mini, and more.

For a lot of people mentally, Apple is still riding high on the innovations of the Jobs era, meanwhile that hasn't been the Apple we've had for a very long time.",
Apple will continue to fall behind the curve even if they try and catch up others will still progress forward. One of Apple biggest advantages was privacy and not sharing user info but to build ai effectively you need user data to build the models effectively and efficiently. Iâ€™m not saying privacy is not a big deal but the foundation that Apple was built on is the exact opposite of what you need to build AI. Google has a lot of user data and open ai trains its models on user data so does grok. In order for apple to progress forward they will have to open up the cloud and I donâ€™t believe they will not saying itâ€™s wrong but you cant have it both ways. They will need to innovate some other kind of way if there is any beyond AI which I donâ€™t believe it is,
"#### 1. **Appleâ€™s True DNA: Hardware & Integration, Not Core Tech Innovation**

Appleâ€™s strength has *never* been building cutting-edge technology from first principles. Instead, its genius lies in:

* **Polishing existing tech** and wrapping it in flawless hardware + UX.
* Building **closed ecosystems** that â€œjust workâ€ (e.g., iPod + iTunes, iPhone + App Store).
* Leading with **design, user experience, and vertical integration**, not raw innovation.

They are the masters of **consumer hardware as lifestyle product**, not fundamental R\&D.

> Apple didnâ€™t invent the smartphone, the tablet, the smartwatch, or even the GUI â€” they just *perfected* them for mass adoption.

---

#### 2. **AI Is Fundamentally a Software & Infrastructure Game**

AI isnâ€™t just software â€” itâ€™s **infrastructure-scale computation**, bleeding-edge model training, open-source iteration, and recursive product feedback loops.

Thatâ€™s why:

* **Google** (with DeepMind, TensorFlow, Gemini) was ready.
* **Microsoft** (with Azure, OpenAI partnership, Copilot) was ready.
* Even **Meta** (despite chaos) is building LLaMA and core foundation models.

Apple? No open-source presence. No LLM breakthrough. No AI labs with first-party papers.
They didnâ€™t even *publicly* talk about AI for years.

Why? Because theyâ€™re not structured around **deep algorithmic innovation**. Their stack is vertically integrated hardware â†’ OS â†’ UI polish.

---

#### 3. **They Buy Innovation, Not Build It**

Appleâ€™s MO is:

* Wait until a technology matures â†’
* Acquire a company â†’
* Integrate it into their product line.

They **bought** Siri. They **bought** PrimeSense (which became FaceID).
Theyâ€™re rumored to be building AI now â€” but itâ€™s **retroactive**. They're not shaping the field. They're adapting to it.

Contrast that with Google, which *created* the transformer architecture (the foundation of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

---

#### 4. **They Were Caught Flat-Footed by the AI Shift**

Because their culture isn't structured for:

* Open research.
* Iterative deployment.
* Rapid-scale model training.
* Open developer communities.

They had to scramble in 2024â€“2025 with on-device LLMs and private AI â€” but itâ€™s **reactionary**.

Their AI is framed around protecting their hardware moat (""Apple Intelligence"" must run on-device to preserve privacy), not advancing the field.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Final Judgment:

**You are absolutely correct** in your central point:

> ðŸ”¥ *Apple fell behind in AI because theyâ€™re not a technology company in the foundational sense â€” they are a hardware company with a software skin.*

In the AI age, that distinction **is fatal at the frontier**. They can still *integrate* AI beautifully into their products, but theyâ€™re not leading â€” and they never will unless their corporate DNA changes.",
"** *Apple Didnâ€™t Fall Behind in AI â€” They Were Never a Tech Company to Begin With*

**Note:**
The reason Apple fell behind Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI isnâ€™t just timing â€” itâ€™s identity.
**Apple is not a technology company.** Thatâ€™s the fundamental misunderstanding people keep making.

Apple is, and has always been, a **hardware company**. They build sleek, functional devices that scale well and do utility tasks in beautiful, fashionable packaging. But when it comes to the AI era â€” the era of *pure software*, adaptive intelligence, and dynamic systems â€” Apple is structurally unprepared.

AI is not a hardware product. Itâ€™s not about devices. Itâ€™s about intelligence at the code layer, behavior prediction, cognition modeling, and recursive learning systems.

Thatâ€™s why Microsoft is thriving â€” theyâ€™re a *real* technology company.
Thatâ€™s why Google and OpenAI are leading â€” theyâ€™re *software-first* companies.

Apple? Apple builds **things**, not minds.
Their business model, internal talent structure, and product philosophy have always prioritized physical hardware, not adaptive software.

Theyâ€™ve tried to catch up by **buying** coders and acquiring smaller AI firms, but you canâ€™t bolt on a software soul. Apple was never designed to compete in this kind of war.

And thatâ€™s why they froze when the AI wave hit.
Not because they were late â€”
**But because they were never meant to be there.**",

"iOS has been pretty bad for a few years now. â€œIt just worksâ€ couldnâ€™t be further from the truth these days. 

Example (1/100 I could give): When using the color picking tool in mark up, the tool doesnâ€™t ignore its own UI shadow, making the tool useless. Thatâ€™s really sloppy and been an issue for multiple iOS versions. 

Or how about UI elements that overlap each other and make both hard to use? Or the absurd new photos app? Or Siri not being able to perform basic functions or anything to do with controlling hardware?

Or maybe the $1700 phone I bought being excluded from new features just a few months after I bought it.

"Apple is clearly a mess internally when its comes to AI and this will cause them some issues going forward. On the other hand the last 6 months shows that AI challengers have technically caught up to OpenAI. There are also strong indications that both pure LLM scaling is failing and that newer 'reasoning' models have limitations and don't provide across the board improvements.Â 

If the LLM architecture has fundamental limits and continues to have the same reliability issues going forward, it's clear that any gains will be incremental or targeted towards certain applications. We can see that coding is a good application (because developers are used to debugging unreliable code) and hybrid systems (mixture of LLMs and traditional AI) such as AlphaEvolve, AlphaFold, AlphaGo etc... have been very successful. However, these are specific applications and don't prove that AI can be reliable or economically useful in general (eg a reliable personal assistant).

In the unlikely event that LLMs continue to scale then Apple will be in trouble long term, but it's more likely that LLM hit limits. Apple could then catch up to the state of the art, the gap between local and cloud LLMs could also narrow (due to continued optimisation and increase in RAM). This would encourage developers to use the free local models, since cloud models are really expensive to run.",

Chills literal chills !"
"Also, Iâ€™ve never enabled ai feature and probably wonâ€™t for a long time. Iâ€™d prefer to struggle and also filter where I put my energy",
"I don't think Apple had a single hit in recent times, iPhone mini was too slow seller for them, iPhones in general didn't get any significant upgrades (island is imo worse than notch, it's bigger and intrudes more down into the content), vision pro was a complete fail, you said everything that needs to be said about AI, this new glass update looks like android skin and leaks are indicating that it's ultra buggy and in some instances unusable and they plan to release it in 3 months, even some internal memos are pointing at iPhone plus being a fail as well. Their market share finally stared falling globally last year, so I'm hoping this is the shakeup they need.",
"I like it when Appel delays things , we all should practice that. Not cool to over marketing though. I do have 20 years of tech engineering and design. Of course itâ€™s just my personal take",
"I still like the idea of the on-device AI, only issue is that after messing around with LLM's on my PC with a RTX 4090 I don't exactly see how Apple can deliver on that point with an iPhone (?).

If Apple drops the ""on-device"" part and goes balls deep into cloud processing like Gemini, they are so far behind today that I don't believe they will ever catch up",
But they have new icons!,
They are one generation away for people having measured advantage to switching from apple,
"They will copy chat gpt and add some colours from 2014 and call it apple intelligence 2.0, and the apple fanbois be happy.",
"Itâ€™s crazy they would soft launch a shitty ai when people donâ€™t even currently want to use Siri because of how shitty that is, further damaging their reputation",
Dumb ppl buy Apple for show off mostly in the west and people in India blindly copy Western culture.ðŸ˜Š,
"Gemini has really surprised me with how quick they have been updating and letting you try paid features before they go live. Sometimes you get to experience things that just don't go live but are really interesting. Makes you wonder how useful it will be when they polish it and launch those features. Gemini has helped me a lot with multitasking, finding stuff i thought was lost on my drive/mail and making scripts for spreadsheets. Image generation is still pretty sub par, but hope it keeps getting better.","Interesting. I've been holding off on really engaging with the AI features of my phone, but I really should take the time to learn more and see what use I can actually get from them."
it seems I will stay with iPhone 15 until this is fixed or I will migrate to Samsung.,

"Apple is too big now. Thay had all the profit from iPhone and software walled garden ecosystem. Why would they waste money to invest in new tech? They are now like Intel decade ago, they are drunk from their own success. when the competitor show up in the future, they will be powerless and can't compete anymore. Look how bad Intel right now by delaying technology upgrade",
"It was all done for something called ""stocks"".... they so wanted to ride the wave but literally had 4 twigs put together and called it a boat. Illegal on so many levels",
"A lot of people see Apple as making a mistake by not getting on AI sooner. But I think their mistake was trying to get in on it at all. Everyone knows that â€˜AIâ€™ makes systems less secure, and theyâ€™ve been marketing themselves as a security and privacy company for years. There is and has always been a large market for this, and positioning their brand as being the anti-AI company, who prioritizes security and privacy over â€œinnovationâ€ could have worked well for them.

I personally donâ€™t want Apple AI or  any AI system running latently in the background of my phone, consuming all of my data, and seeing everything I do on my phone. Iâ€™m sure the majority of people donâ€™t either.",
"Apple has always put in the extra effort ripping off the innovation of others, such as Google Maps and Spotify, but the ol' copy machine is really struggling with this AI thing.",
"(liquid gas) When discussing Apple, itâ€™s important to recognize a common pattern seen throughout industry history: companies that rely too heavily on the success of a single product risk complacency. Instead of actively innovating and responding to changing customer needs and new technologies, they may slow down and assume past achievements guarantee future dominance. Meanwhile, competitors continue to push boundaries with fresh products and services. If Apple does not maintain its innovation momentum, it could face challenges similar to those experienced by once-dominant companies that lost relevance over tim",

Spent all R&D budget on Liquid Glass!,
"I believe that since Apple was an underground and non business focused company, it never received defense contracts. Therefore it was never brought into later on projects that developed AI. Resulting in their slow output of AI",

"I got an iPhone 16 Pro as my first ever iPhone after using an Android phone (Sony for six years, Samsung for 8) since 2011, and I would say Apple has a great marketing team, that's all.",
"Appleâ€™s product categories are starting to merge. 

iPadâ€™s software and hardware are becoming more powerful and some people will just get an iPad. 

MacOS visually appears to be preparing for touchscreens. Thereâ€™s more space between menu text and visual sliders. When Macâ€™s get touch screens, some people wonâ€™t buy iPads. 

Foldable iPhones may eat into iPad sales. 

If Apple TVs are continued to be upgraded, they will eventually be as powerful as current Mac Minis. Why couldnâ€™t Apple TVs (in the future) also run MacOS? 

It appears Apple sees this future coming. All new Apple devices use Appleâ€™s chips. This could be why Apple has taken a baby step of naming all new OSâ€™s with the same number. Eventually, Apple may merge some of its OSs. This could reduce development costs. 

At the same time, Apple knows it needs new products and/or services to sell.",
"Apple gained sales by pushing privacy and then lost sales because privacy made it hard for Apple to deliver AI. 

The push for privacy has also cost advertising efficiency. This had flow on effects tooâ€¦ 

Reduced efficiency (and efficiency potential) hits a combination of profit, prices, wage growth.

More profit flows onto either more investment or more spending or reduced debt. 

Some niche businesses arenâ€™t viable without this efficiency (unlike a brand like Colgate who can market their toothpaste quite broadly).",
"Apple hardware has lagged behind Android options for years, and now their software does, as well. Ease of use (and social statusðŸ™„) was their main selling point, I thought. No more, apparently.",
I still write and deploy Cobol on a 386. I am your master. Bow to me.,
Artificial Intelligence planned by Natural Stupidity.,
"Because modern apple is run by sales/marketing people, not product people. As Steve Jobs pointed out, when sales/marketing takes over, companies forget about the product.",
4:00 that's hilarious. Google has already been automatically adding items to the calendar from emails for 10 years. I had to turn it off because it annoyed the crap out of me. Why is Apple just now trying to make that work? Oh right. They're always years behind.,
I hate AI.,

"We donâ€™t care ,they lied.",
Thanks For This Video,
"As a head of software and product manager myself, when a head of software is shocked about what his phone can actually do vs. what was promised, it is either one of the following:
- he is unfitting to the job, it is his main job to know exactly what the software is capable of, and, more importantly, what not 
- he is lying to cover up
- a mix of the above
Both variants are simply put unacceptable. Apple's board can sacrifice him as a pawn to move on, but the probability that they didn't know either is below 10%.

This is what we get when we blindly follow empty promises all along as Elon Musk is the undoubted king of unfulfilled promises getting rich of them showing others what is rewarded by society.",

Johnie Ivy saw this earlier on. He was not happy with what was happening and where apple was going. He chose to leave.,

I think you undersold this video by making it about the AI Disaster part. It would've probably been better if the video was named something along the lines of The actions that led to the Disaster of Apple's AI. I didn't watch it before because I already knew it was bad but now I'm watching it I finalIy know how it came to be bad.,
Apple hasn't been the same without Steve Jobs. Just like the Lakers haven't been the same since Dr. Buss died.,
"I like how you say ""rare failure"" yet Apple fails all the time.. maybe you're an Apple user yourself so you say ""rare failure"" ... Apple WAS innovative long ago when Steve Jobs was alive.. once Tim Cook took over, he ruined Apple. Nowadays they're just.. pardon my language.. assholes. If anybody buys Apple today are just not smart people. Especially Mac users (considering expensive price)",
Apple cheated everyone who bought iPhone 16 this year. There is no fucking Apple AI inside!!!!!!!,

The worst part? The iPhone is the hardest part of the Apple ecosystem to walk away from. Itâ€™s the anchor. But once thatâ€™s gone, itâ€™s only a matter of time before people want their laptop and tablet to also live in the same AI-first world. Thatâ€™s how the BlackBerry fall happenedâ€”slow at first, then all at once.

Itâ€™s wild because Apple has incredible chips. But they didnâ€™t build the GPU infrastructure. They didnâ€™t push the AI frontier the way they could have. They still can. But Microsoft saw it coming and doubled down on cloud + AI early. Apple chose not to.

If they donâ€™t turn the ship soon, this could be their biggest miss in decades.","They don't have a chance, my friend. Read about Jony Ive and Sam Altman's new partnership and the AI product they are building. They've been talking about this for two years. And Apple still can't get Siri right? They've been smoked."
More blinding white screens Dagogo...,
Down with Apple,
This is a bigggg boowomp moment for apple,
Isn't all AI a failure ?,
"AI is still vaporware 

LLMs are not thinking",
The CEO must go!,
It's very apple-like to copy other people's technology and claim it as their own. They just hide it well until now,
"Well, as you said, Apple is known for sitting back and waiting for others to work through the initial R&D before swooping in to polish it up. 

But Ai isnâ€™t something that they can afford to sit on. Things are moving too quickly. If they donâ€™t get on it during the early days of the tech, then theyâ€™re gonna be screwed",

"I love how everyone is pretending that Apple is just now ""starting to overripen"" when (cr)Apple has been... ""not so good"" since at least those colourful CRT-G4 cubes came out in the late 90s/early 2000s. The ipod was just a fluke in terms of good quality (and even then, it was blown out by literally every single mp3-player in the same category that came out around that time when it came to audio quality and price/performance ratio).
Apple is, and has always been, good at one single thing: Marketing.

*Edit:* And since I forgot it, let me add my comments on the (first) iPhone: It launched without an app store, something everyone else already had. Nokia (Sybian), Linux (duh, they invented it) and even plain old JavaME capable phones all had some form of app-store. Except Apple of course.",
Only reason I own an iPhone 12 Mini is that it came for free with a phone plan. I have never used Siri and never felt the need either.,
Apple should be punished severely!,
"Beside of software and tech one of the main selling point on asian market is prestige luxury brand sign of wealth in asian yourh population,but is not the same on eu and usa with the tech and software started lagged being sondoes the sale",

"Apple can't spend billions of dollars.

OpenAi and Google are specifically AI companies and they've burned billions making AI

You can't just ""hire people"" and ""make an LLM""

It's too big. I think even for apple.

Apple needs to take an arrow to the knee, and focus on other things 

Having a partnership with Google would probably deliver stunning results.

Have other stuff to outcompete people.",

Apple should buy Anthropic.,
lol @ Apple,
I use Microsoft Copilot every day. It works well and they're always updating it.,
"Things would be different if Steve Jobs were still here. That said, I think software isn't Apple's best strength. They make amazing hardware. Maybe one day we'll have iPhones powered by an Apple-forked version of Android. Just saying ðŸ˜…",

Sounds a awful lot like Nokia an their internal struggles with symbian and android,
"So apple ðŸŽ intelligence showed there was none, they are living on legacy.",
"Unfortunately, there was no equal available for Steve to hand his company to. Tim Cook was the best he had and we all knew deep down inside that he wasnâ€™t good enough. He was good enough to delay the implosion for so long, but he does not have the drive or vision that Steve had! If they cannot get themselves out of the box, they put themselves in, Apple will unfortunately become ordinary.",
This is outrageous and I mean outrageous!!!!,
This sounds a lot like Boeing.,
"Por favor para una prÃ³xima entrega, podrÃ­as desactivar el doblaje automÃ¡tico, odio cuando los videos estÃ¡n en espaÃ±ol con voz de IA que no se escuchan naturales.",
"This isn't something new. Apple has ALWAYS done this. I remember the first iOS release where Steve Jobs could not switch between screens and just played it off. Apple's software has never been ""polished"" or ""the best"". Thats what their consistent software updates were for. The reason Apple has the rep it has is due to fanboys and fangirls who wanted to pretend owning an Apple product meant they were special (or had money). Android has basically exposed their lack of innovation and creating useful products. Where do you think imposters like Elon Musk role outs mimick for his Tesla releases. Ijs",
When I upgrade my iPhone one of the first things I do is shut down Siri.  It has never made a compelling use case,

"Honestly, from the latest presentation by Apple, who could say the Glassy look is actually innovative? Also who asked for it? ColdFusion is right - Apple has gone stale.",
"Apple is big time DEI hiring. A bunch of ""touchy"" goofballs misguiding the ship. And who cares about ""liquid glass"" when they can't even get average AI going. Jobs would have bought Open AI before anyone had heard of it.",
"I canâ€™t believe people are using a first developer beta as an example of buggy software. Of course itâ€™s buggy, thatâ€™s the point!
Using liquid glass as an example of buggy software in your video opening is not very convincing",

"When they started worrying about, forcing their customers to have a subscription for every single thing, that was a big sign of issues. Apple Music, Apple news, photos, iCloud, health for your watch, Apple TV, and the list can keep on going. So not only do you have to buy $1000 iPhone to use the majority of it features you have to fork out extra monthly subscription fee fees.  And then they want to get into TV doing their own TV shows movies, etc. Fail....",
Did Peter Molyneux start at Apple? That would explain the broken promises ðŸ˜‚.,
a dropout ran the company better,
A RARE failure? Apples walled garden is a gated prison. IOS is garbage now. Paying $1000 for a phone with fewer and worse features than an android from 10 years ago. Absolutely aweful corporation.,
"4:55 Apple has always played a long game: they  wait to see how others flop or succeed then enter with a polished product that redefines the category.

"This whole thing is a microcosm of the current state of AI in general. The current AI programming architecture is much more limited than most people realize. There is no real intelligence to it. Rather it is just a fancy way of summarizing the internet. The features promised here are not possible with Large Language Models. No matter how much computing power companies throw at the problem. This is why we donâ€™t have self driving cars, in home robots, nor personal assistants. 

Our present AI architectures donâ€™t do the job and they canâ€™t. Weâ€™ll have to come up with something new. And it is unlikely that we will anytime soon.",
"You would assume that a CEO of a company with more than 100.000 employees cannot really change its direction anymore, because there is just too much management between them and the development teams. Sitting thousands of miles apart, the teams will be disconnected from any C-level decisions and all that they can influence is work culture, ideology and logos, but they can't really control the products anymore. This is true for 99% of companies but Steve Jobs proved it wrong, he will be missed.",
If Steve was still CEO they would have aced AI.,
I guess the Appleâ€™s rotten right to the core.,
"its very simple. Apple is copy cat. thats what they have done in hardware, apple store apps etc list is long but when it comes to doing something of their own, they suck. They wont be able to do anything in this sphere",
I love watching apple fail - long overdue.,
"The loop is closing. 
Apple in 2025 is Nokia in 2007.",
"From what I've seen, the software issues are only going to worsen with the release of iOS 26.",
"Apple has been a joke since Steve died, and technically even before that. You all just thought you had something special. For years, Apple has been stealing and using others' ideas, such as Samsung & Google. Again, you all just chose to believe they are something special.",

"My experience with Siri is that almost everything I ask for, it cannot deliver. If I ask it to play a specific song from my playlist - especially if the song has a non-English name (so pretty much all of Schubert, Bach, Scarlatti, Monteverdi etc) and it will play some random modern pop song. It then reinforces itself, thinking that these songs are part of my music history and playlist. I listen to virtually no non-classical music, and none at all from the 21st Century, but 21st Century pop is all it ever finds. It will be funny if Apple cracks GenAI just as the bubble bursts :-)",
lots of bugs in apple ui these days and its getting glichy,
Amazing and riveting to watch as per usual. Thank you mate. Also love the use of Monument Valley OST,
"This is quite typical generation jump issue. Previous generation leader cannot adapt to the new for one reason or another and often quickly fades away. Like Kodak, or Nokia. 

It probably is also reason why in many â€œrichâ€ countries some infrastructure things are so ancient - like slow network connections while in â€œpoorâ€ countries might be installing fibre connections to homes as they donâ€™t have the old infra maintenance load to worry about.",
Never bought an Apple product. I'm glad about that.,
EU will most likely never have access to apple AI.,
Do More With Less ...that is DeepSeek ðŸ˜Š,
Apple without Steve Jobs,
Apple is a hardware company with some software. Microsoft is a software company with some hardware. We can't expect both companies to be hardware and software experts. That's not how things work.,
Did you forget Siri? It's not a rare failure.. we are tired of that narrative.,
"I feel scammed. I only bought the 16 because of the features promised with Apple Intelligence. People are too brainwashed to call Apple out when they fail, thatâ€™s starting to change but itâ€™s still subtle. Majority of tech reviewers tend to act as if they work for Apple.",
Apple needs to hire Peter Molyneux.  That'll do,
"Apple has been playing cool for years on dwindling reputation. Colored text bubble, wtf childish bs.",
"Apple is doing the SAME mistake what Nokia and Blackberry made. Not innovating quickly and eventually out of the race. 
But Apple has more resources to fast-track development. Let's see what happens in the next couple of years. 
I hope the Apple Sheeps actually wake up and think.",
"Tim Cook has no vision, he fooled Steve Jobs and now itâ€™s obvious and too late",
"so apple died when their creator died?
same as spongebob direction? (that become aimless)",
"I think if Apple continues in this direction, they might end up similar to Nokiaâ€”not dead, but losing their iPhone and Watch sales. The smartphone market will likely be led by: Samsung, Nothing,Pixel",
The AI comic in the middle really threw me off. Looks weird and kind of cringe.,
Just realized woke has made me hate rainbows,
"Apple, especially iphone customers don't care about tech as much as we do. Apple can take their time, I don't believe the general Public sees what we techies see. Otherwise Apple wouldn't be on top of the smartphone shipments number (always battling Samsung)",

"Couldnâ€™t help myself after seeing the â€žbuggyâ€œ software in this video..

What do people think when they install a beta version of a software, that theyâ€™re getting a full, working version? For those who donâ€™t know, to get beta software for Appleâ€˜s devices, you need to sign up for their Developer Program. Whatâ€™s that for? Then you already shouldnâ€™t post â€žbuggyâ€œ beta software and complain about it on social media!

To be honest, I am disappointed for â€žcomplaintsâ€œ like that be featured here. Your editors should know better. Highlighting complaints about beta software and making it seem like this is what everyoneâ€˜s getting is just sensationalizing a non-issue. Do complaints about beta software/apps from other companies get featured like this?

Yes, I know, this comment isnâ€™t about the topic of the video. I just think itâ€™s wrong to highlight whatâ€™s wrong with social media, with most people just never understanding things.",I find coldfusion videos are often misleading spin. Probably paid for by invested interests

"Steve jobs who used multiple iphone's during the demo of the first iphone since they were not functioning fully, seeing all this.

Its not just AI thats a disaster at Apple...,
"The whole thing reminds me of Amazon Alexa. I've been using it since the first Echo generation, and I don't feel like anything has improved significantly since then. The difference between Alexa and Apple Intelligence, however, is that even Alexa's lamentable basic functions make it an integral and important part of my everyday life: alarm clock, timer, weather report, news, Spotify, and so on. And all the services that are important to me still work on the very first Echo generation! 

Sadly, I can't say the same about Siri. Personally, I find Siri unpleasant to use, especially when other people are around. As soon as I address Siri and don't immediately say the command, what feels like less than a second later, it replies with a rather cheeky ""Aha?"" as if to say, ""What are you bothering me with again?"". For one of the world's most valuable technology companies, it's a pitiful product.

Edit: I just asked Perplexity if there's a way to turn off this Siri behavior. The answer: ""You can set Siri to respond silently. Go to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri Responses and select 'Silent Responses.' This will prevent Siri from speaking unless you're driving or using headphones with the screen off."" I tried it and it didnâ€™t work. ðŸ™„",

Appleâ€™s only hope at this point is to bring Steve Jobs back to life,

Hate the instrumental at the beginning. Just two people talking over each other,
Apple leadership NEEDS to change at this point. I think that they've completed their purpose for their era. It's time for someone new taking into consideration the new level of technology and future outlook for their sector to take the helm. They're played out at this point. The Apple Car= Nothing. Apple Intelligence= Nothing. Apple groundbreaking devices= Nothing. Apple Vision= Nothing. Apple...........................SMH,

"Everyone hating on Apple tells me I need to get the next IPhone, Apple is wise to take its time with AI, just wait and see! You can be first with AI, but how do you know you arenâ€™t first to make a mistake? AI is a mess! Right now! Apple knows better, but to each their own.",

Apple died with Steve Jobs. Weâ€™ve witnessed a decade of death twitches.,
"Well, Apple is known for its slacked approach to innovation. They roll out at features that have existed for a at least a decade rebranded with some catchy title like Liquid Glass (has existed in Windows for 2 decades now).

"This is what happens when uninspired corporate leaders become the heads of companies. Steve Jobs was a visionary, a creative, connected to The Muse, whose inspiration and risk-taking took the company to sky heights. Now, every decision is made in a calculator.

Appleâ€™s apple cuz of developers and app ecosystem and giving them the AI keys is a big step in the right direction and with all the wrongs theyâ€™d had, Iâ€™d still bet on them that when they get it right even iPhone 15(pros) will get the most bonkers features even though iphone 18-19 is when it happened(sadly 17 wonâ€™t be it but weâ€™ll see)",
Doesn't matter because the biggest cult of 21st century is Apple. Tesla was on track but failed.  The blind supporters of Apple are many. The crowd is crazy mad. Who needs products or AI.,
"What people seem donâ€™t want to admit is that, the idea of Generative AI trends itself is a bad idea. I always said Apple never should following this trend, but they did, failure was inevitable.

IMO is the apple mentality is its worst enemy. cannot be  clsed environment and look for global awareness.,
Apple lost the AI race. They are as innovative as Gucci. But they can still win the race against AI and double-down on privacy and security. Leave the actual AI to apps from other companies but give users even stronger control over what those apps can access from their information.,
"All AI is a breach/thief of privacy and copyright laws, you just don't know it yet and are too excited. Apple is being the sentinel of security that it always has been. Only time will tell why Apple hesitated and these other companies rushed. Samsung blew up phones in your pocket once.

It's like a closed loop system which makes everything secure and harder to hack into, but limits innovation and the ability to come out with new tech.",honestly foldable phones feel a bit like a gimmick that no one really wants like wireless charging

"Not surprised. They have an internal culture of arrogance, not interested in other points of view. Coming from someone who's interviewed with them multiple times.",
Apple has been going downhill ever since the death of Steve Jobs.,
Anyone else is tired of the whole AI thing? Apple messing up their AI is a positive in my opinion. It is getting increasingly more difficult to find new devices that are not primarily a screen for AI apps for someone who does not care about the whole trend.,
Apple DIED when Jobs did...No soul...No vision...just profits!,
Siri has always been a gimmick to me. Iâ€™ve had every generation of iPhone since the original. Iâ€™ve maybe asked Siri to name a song five times and I think it was only able to do it once. Never asked Siri to do anything else.,
"Well analysed, they basically missed the boat with Siri by turning it first into what Google Assistant or Alexa became and after that most importantly by adding AI to it.
Intead of that they took TOO BIG of a bite which they couldnâ€™t chew in developing Apple car or Vision Pro headset, which doesnâ€™t sell.
Siri & AI should be their no.1 priority from the beginning even before Chat GPT came to the market.
They made mistakes and miscalculated AIs potentialâ€¦",

The irony of using generative AI on your visuals for a video talking about a different AI failure.,That's not irony.
The irony of using generative AI on your visuals for a video talking about a different AI failure.,"I'm not sure why it bothers you so much. They used a tool to create visuals, which you can decide for yourself whether you think are effective. Apple have barely managed to create AI anything, all while lying about the capabilities of their new iPhone, which is something entirely different with much much higher stakes than a single YouTube video."
"Siri has been out for more than 15 years, but it still can complete with rivals. I have an iPhone 15 Plus. However, I avoid using Siri as much a s possible. I don't think Apple Intelligence Siri would be much better if at all.",

"Very few are able to admit the truth: Steve Jobs is to blame for this and other failures. His model of running company is what is flawed. Its about putting total control and power into hands of technologically incompetent marketing people, like Jobs himself. While it was all about products, this was doable. But when everything transfers to services and things that do not have outward physical appearance these people show their true faces.",

"When are people gonna realize that the expectations set by the AI industry and advocates will never be met. Thereâ€™s not enough content in existence to build better models unless AI-curated content, which is flawed because itâ€™s generated with old or existing models, is included in the training data.","This is what I keep saying. AI models scraped the internet without permission, and the internet has centuries of documented human history, art, and literature. If that's not enough data for a model to be perfect, I really doubt that ""just another year of new data"" is going to fix anything. The only solution I see is having a team of tens of thousands of people looking at responses that AI gives, giving corrections, and having AI build a database of corrections so it doesn't ""guess"" something wrong twice. But then again, it'll probably keep guessing wrong, just in new ways. If AI has to keep being corrected, it'll never be ready."

Watching AI slop science or history videos actually reduces knowledge, there's just so much BS that it's impossible to fact check it.
Furthermore all the AI slop art getting stored is exceeding the production capacity of drives and real diligent human creators are going to be frozen out by get rich quick merchants into AIxploitation."

The XPS series were far ahead in terms of design and even upgradability than macbooks. So much so, by the time apple started to go more bezeless, dell started to make the XPS series worse and worse. Apple has never had good cooling prior to the M chips, so much so, windows laptops with more powerhungry parts and similar weight/size had far better cooling systems. Namely gaming laptops. With ryzen 4000, they even started to beat intel versions of macbooks in terms of battery life.",

Apple Intelligence's notification summary for the Onion looks about right.,
"Apple has to go down now.. itâ€™s been a long time that Apple stopped the world of inventions on the gadgets that we hold.. all the engineers of the world are working for 1 thing. Smartphone..

"Cook is a bean counter manager. Heâ€™s not a visionary like jobs.
It raises the eternal question can a company survive its founderâ€™s death.
There are many  examples of companies that eventually went wrong once the founder and their vision were gone. I think thatâ€™s what weâ€™re seeing here.
That being said, I recently tried a Samsung phone and tablet and the experience both in terms of how smooth it is and the visual aspect are still superior on the Apple platform .

overly dramatic music* at least for the first song,
"Isn't this story similar to Elon Musk's promise of ""full self driving"" and ""robo taxis""?  Why isn't there a class action law suit against that fraudster Nazi?  He promised things that aren't being delivered and has now even admitted that the current hardware in Tesla cars will never be capable of full self drive despite publicly stating that it was coming soon.

"I feel like Apple became a cashcow since Jobs died. No vision, no innovation just higher prices for products.",That's who and what Cook is...a bean counter...all numbers and no creativity!
Never knew Iâ€™d say this but Apple might end up like Nokia or Blackberry,
"But what strikes me is that, this company with such shattered history and open idiocy still manages to sell millions of phones every year. The consumers have become mindless robots just buying into the fad giving money only to be told 'soon' for something which others do offer now. Truly dystopian times !!",
"As I watch this, my iPhone keeps crashing YouTube",
Apple's downfall is just following  the U.S downfall.,
Crapple.,
"Apple is the best when it comes to BS-ing consumers, especially when overpromising, overvaluing their products and services. Them being the best working software in the smartphone world has been over since around 2018. It is only a matter of time if they won't willing to change pace, they will be outcompeted by others in every way, Siri was never the best assistant in the first place and now it is even worse",
it is a sign of Apple's decline. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius but even he was not a legit engineer or computer scientist who can truly understand LLM. So that's Apple's identity after Jobs death -- a marketing company.,
TIM COOK  cooked Apple,
"Luke  Miani, the apple sheep with no subjects anymore",
Siri is basically worthless at this point other than making calls or text to someone.,"only thing i used her for was setting timers.  ive long since turned siri off, its a spy feature is all"
How can one of the richest companies in the world not implement AI in their OS while it is available even in open source.,
Apple supplies tech products to people who are not good with technology. Nothing impressive about it.,

Maybe they have to stop the new iphone release this year until Apple delivers what they promised last year..,
"I think it's
Apple's Nokia moment

long way going down",
What is the song at the very start of this video? I remember hearing it in a playlist,
"Apple as a company might be in the same situation where many other very successful companies have been in the past. At the complacency stage where the company thinks that it is at the top of the world in its chosen field of business and that no one can touch it. This also happened to companies like Kodak, IBM, Nokia and so on.",
The ONE good thing that came out of Apple Intelligence is Apple finally bumping up their base model Macs to 16gb RAM.,
"Is it possible that this is a play by Apple ? This has always been their play, polish up janky systems or Protoss products into a polished products. Apple has been great at this, now they are plying the long game again on a very large scale.  Maybe, just maybe we are on the verge of one of apples biggest surprises to date.",
"to be fair at the times that Apple does use AI it is actually good uses, like the information button is the gallery",
"not sure whats wrong with my whatsapp, i have to restart my phone every now and then",
Well at least apple is not using our personal data to train their AI,lol yes they are
"Less Innovations, More on Marketing. They are definitely left behind.",
"~3.5 mins of unnecessary intro, before the real content of the video begins at 3:36! 
Not impressed ðŸ‘Ž
It's a pity because the video itself is well made and informative, but c'mon already and get to the point!",
I feel like they have cornered themself!,
"It is clear that Apple needs to buy a number of companies in the AI hardware and software and robotics industry. 
It's time to put those 100's of billions to work.  There is no use in having a massive cashpile if you end up bankrupt because you sat on the sidelines doing nothing.
Or merge with a vertically integrated company or strategic JV .
JV with Google and Tesla would put them back in the games like yesterday. Apple can build an Apple car using Tesla platform cars and just add the Apple design and software on top. With a Google JV, Apple could  use their AI models and server farms.

It will cost Apple a lot but not as much as starting from scratch.",
Steve Jobs wasnâ€™t scared to cannibalise products. The current senior leadership team are and itâ€™s Appleâ€™s biggest downfall.,
The clueless and visionless corporate folk at Apple fell victim to AI hype and FOMO. Jobs would have never allowed this.,
we want only 1 AI feature and that is: AI Photo and Video Detection (when you scroll your instagram feed or tiktok feed we need to know if we watch AI or real video) we dont need other AI garbage features,
What is the song in the intro? Itâ€™s wonderful,
"Apple become too confident on the strategy that soly based on the market where it take atleast 1 year to get a mainstream upgrade.

This simply does not work at all in a space where everyone growing rapidly every single week",
We should not need AI for everything. The more AI there is the less we are living and thinking for ourselves.,
But my question is do we really need advanced AI to the mobile?,
"Hopefully people start to realize that Apple has never been good at creating software. They just buy stuff from start ups and other companies and give it a polished look. ""AI"" is mostly crap all over the globe, as far as I can see it's pretty much a scam or a gimmick. So of course apple can't deliver a good product because they can't buy anything that already works because nothing works.",
Siri is garbage,
"If you hire , managers instead of technologists, your tech company becomes a mgmt company",
"Management being over ambitious. Dev teams struggling with stable system, at same time the scope was revised plagued the Apple",
"Itâ€™s time for Cook to go. Apple has been so stagnant since the passing of Jobs. All there is now is wow look this iPhone has a slightly larger screen, slightly better camera. 

What happened to innovation?",
"I don't need ai to use my phone. I use ai for other things but not to ""use"" for phone things.",
Apple has been falling behind for years. They have them innovative and at least 10 years.,
"Galaxy AI is already pretty much polished, utility orientet ande deeply rooted all over the UI.
Apple here fell far behind.
Only USP for apple is video recording consistency on quality, rest in every other dimension, its loosing far behind",
They think they re too big and have stagnated thats just it,
Tim Cook is in the clouds.,
DEI,
I would never call Apple Intelligence a failure. It finally made them put 16GB of ram on their base models. Complete win in my book.,
There should be Section 288 consequences for Apple ðŸ˜¡.,
I'm surprised Apple remains on top of the most valuable company despite having incompetent leaders.,That's true
I'm surprised Apple remains on top of the most valuable company despite having incompetent leaders.,"Apple's only real value has always been the same. They are pretend competition so the actual major players (Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) can pretend they aren't literal monopolies."
Apple has been using and building machine learning into the OS way before AI became a buzz world. What do you mean,
"If your definition of AI is just a glorified chatbot, then Siri did fail. But if you count all the other Apple Intelligence enhancements that are practically useful or that most people donâ€™t even realize theyâ€™re already using, then Apple (more than any other company) has done the best job for consumers. Apple has been doing this with ML-powered features for ages now, long before AI became an Nvidia hype train to drive up stock prices.",
Apple No Intelligence,
"Interestingly Google was also caught off guard by OpenAI, but have been able to respond and get back up strongly when it comes to AI. I think Apple plays it way too safe most of the time. When one of the biggest reasons to use an iPhone is to be able to use imessage a piece of software, that could be ported, then you know Apple really don't have anything truly compelling anymore.",
I do believe Apple has been on a slow downwards trajectory since Steve died.,
Not a rare failure but a common theme in past 5 years,
"6:31 This is a really really bad comparison. 

Google cannot do this on-device. Especially Multi-modal. 
Infact, no one knows how to run a SLM which is multimodal locally. 
Install the Edge AI model library from Google and you'll see, how bad Gemini Nano and Flash are at function calling. 

I think this video shows ColdFusion's lack of understanding of the AI model architectures.",
"Apple and Windows both employ tons of H-1Bs. They just got sued for $25m for preferring them over Americans.
Anyway, have fun with that.",
Apple will soon buy deepseek and make a comeback ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥°,
7:55 Man AI art is uglyðŸ¤¢,
"Apple spent $10B to remove â€œHey.â€
Google made an AI that roasts your outfit in real time.
We are not the same.","Rofl,  true"
This calms me as an Apple user because I am a private guy and I care about privacy. All this says is me that Google and Samsung made millions of photos about people and their surroundings to learn their AI. And Apple couldn't as easy or perfect as their competitors because they care about privacy. It's shocking how good Googles and Samsungs AI is. It makes me afraid a bit.,
This what happens when companies value the investors more than their own.,
15:28 Iâ€™m pretty sure they said 2026,
The music is very loud,
Thatâ€™s so un-Karl Farbman-like haha,
"The level of cope over Apple calling out LLMs multiple failures as a useful tool is palpable all over YouTube. Whilst they are no longer the ""it just works company"" they consider that a valid goal and appear to hold to that.
This means they are happy to selll smoke and mirrors but for Apple it needs to be smoke and mirrors they control, thats what FOSS and Free Software advocates hate. But it also means they wont engage in immature tech, that's what Microbros and Cryptobros hate.",
Don't forget Musk robo taxi from more than 12 years ago? Your cars are supposed to run auto taxi when you're asleep. Here we are some 12-15 years later..,
"I think apple are far behind the competition, as they have only made very small improvements (if you call it that?) & relied on the apple users to be loyal n can't leave the eco system  due to them spending so much money on it,  they are stuck in the walled garden, apple have sat back for so long with the money coming in, they didn't advance in technology like other competitors have n now they are panicking & rushing things to catch up but playing catch up is making things worse as they try n if it fails they fake it in the wwdc  n hope they can fix it while they try n sort it out b4 being rolled out...but they fail. The public buy on their promises & now people are losing patience n going elsewhere where, if they don't improve they may be fined big time for false promises & and lose investors & that in turn lose the what once loyalty of apple buyers",
"If it will be Running on the devices, I am willing to wait a little longer. I am sticking to Apple! I can use these Chat Bots all I want anyways via Browser or the App. And as usefull as it might be, I donâ€™t find AI that important personally. But for Business customers it could be much more important",
Face it. Steve should've fired everyone! and brought back Johny Ive. Most sold and popular Apple devices were literally designed by Jonny Ive.,

"AI is overrated, never used it on both android nor iphone.",
Every empire is bound to crumble at any point in time,
"Apple is a company that is too big to fail, has massive ubiquity, and has a market share with the iPhone that guarantees its success, and itâ€™s not terribly interested in software anymore unless itâ€™s things like emojis that get its core audience excited. Basically, itâ€™s become a lifestyle brand that doesnâ€™t have to blow the doors down anymore, which is a shame for us older users who remember the Steve Jobs years.",
"Nowadays you'll find it very hard to come up with a non fanboy reason to actually buy an iPhone. The only thing Apple does better is integration with it's other products (massive selling point). Android has come a very long way and having used both IOS and Android systems side by side in the not so distant past (iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro max, Apple watch SE 1 and 2, Samsung S22 Ultra and S24 Ultra, Galaxy watch 5 pro and Galaxy watch 6) i have enough knowledge to conclude that overall the Android operating system is better and more flexible in general. I did find however that the Apple watch integrated extremely well with the iPhone and was a bit more seamless and smoother in general.",
1:10 the reason why i didnt buy iphone 16 promax,
It was because of Jews? Wasn't it??,
We don't AI honestly,
"I saw Apple market â€˜Knowledge Navigatorâ€™ and wanted one then, and I am still waiting. The depth of seriousness is eminence, this - AI as THE agent between User and Device - is the path to smart home, smart car, smart life, subscription services. WWDC 25 feels lost and loathsome.",
Apple has been left in the dust such a shame to what they once were. Far better products and software elsewhere.,
What> Apple have strings of failure as they refuse to invest at a lost in it for the long term. It's not rare....,
Tim Cook is cooking Appl ðŸ¤£,
"I'm tired of you getting things wrong. Before was Steve Jobs,. Although it might seem you are right about the strategy, the smartphones of the time were nothing like today. The genius of Steve Jobs was making an UI that a 3 or 4 year old can use intuitively, without even knowing the alphabet. This is genius and neccessary.

"My thought exactly, ""well they already got Siri, making an improvement ain't that difficult than making it from a scratch"".

"Also, WWDC25 spent a lot of time hyping the ""Liquid Glass"" UI, which actually is around very 2005-ish, about 20 years ago, with Apple's Aqua (which looked great on the Macs and IPads of the time) and Microsoft's Aero UI  (which looked great on Windows Vista).   Also, Liquid Glass has problems with lack of contrast (as your video generously demonstrates).  Apple (literally) lost it's sheen with Jony Ive's ""flat"" look around iOS7 and OS X 10.9 Mavericks.",
They might as well just adopt Gemini,
This narrator has more AI than apple,
"Yet somehow, Apple diehards STILL think Apple are synonymous with innovation. Innovation my ass, they're behind in every way by 3 to 5 years and the UI is hard to use; more steps to do what Android does in 1 or 2 steps.",
new product or feature -> live event,
Funny thing is apple doesnâ€™t give a f***,
"To be fair, this is why, in the past, Apple limited new features. You can't have it both ways, clearly. Apple wants long term support for every new product or feature they release. They don't want to leave their users high and dry. We all know which company does that...",
There is NOTHING that shareholders won't screw up in their obsession for more roi.,
This will become Nokia 2.0 all over again if they dont do something about it.,

"It's almost like Apple, Nvidia and Intel are charging crazy prices for tech products that aren't any better and often worse than ones that already exist.",
"This is what happens when you run out of ideas. I say this with all sincerity, I don't understand how some people are practically captured in that ecosystem, which is always behind the competition. And Apple needs to think seriously about the future, because it bases its profit far too much on a single product whose popularity is declining and which It has been capped in terms of innovation.",
Wow.. as a hardcore Apple fan I've been watching their ecosystem going downhill every year!,
Siri is good for setting up the alarm.,
"I donâ€™t actually care that Apple doesnâ€™t have decent â€œAIâ€ yet. But I care that they overpromised on something - again - when they had no marketable product, and still donâ€™t a year later. Underpromise, overdeliver. Not promise everything, then deliver nothing. Unless you count bolting ChatGPT onto it. They called the race far, far too early.",
"Jobs designed the headquarters specifically to encourage collaboration and to remove knowledge silos, because it was killing Apple to be fragmented in different directions and conflicting projects. Itâ€™s actually sad to see theyâ€™ve found a way to regress anyway.",
worst control center panel design i ever seen 0:41,
Apple is becoming the next Nokia,
"We think apple don't want to invest too much on AI because the investment was way too expensive just to be used on apple products alone. They need to sell the AI to other company. But since apple would be very closed and highly moderated that would be not viable. So they will just wait for other well polished AI, maybe with all their scheme to force buy them by manipulating the market, something they're very best at.",

Naturally I don't want Apple Intelligence to be using my personal data in its training models. Not if that can leak my data. Data I keep in Apple's iCloud is something I want to be as private as data I've got stored locally.",

Tesla Semi, again in 2017 not ready yet, also faked tests with the prototype.
Full self driving announce in 2016, with ""we can do it now"" about 10 years later, there is no full self driving, but people paid for it, also the tests for it was faked.

Im not saying to worship them or not criticize them but criticize them for things that actually makes sense, the UI has nothing to do with vista, just because vista had a transparent background doesn't mean it's similar.

Apple definitely made a big mistake by not buying Anthropic,
"I guess it depends, it is hard for me to see how much AI is actually used by the general public. I myself played a lot with image and video generation, and I see it being a powerful tool there, LLMs can be also impressive in some cases, however all these are me goofing around, and thus I would not say it has much value for me, other than maybe some entertainment from playing with them.

At work I lead a small team who builds complex 3D mapping software (including stuff like 3D rendering - custom engine, physics simulation, AR/VR, training machine vision AI models etc.). This week I was adding OpenXR support to our engine, also helped out some colleagues on our cloud rendering based web front-end, looked into issues with WebRTC, needed to programmatically turn off gamepad input in a windowed UI depending on current task, and fought some weird issues with MSBuild (Microsoft's build toolset).

During these 5 major problems I asked AI. I was elaborate, so I gave it multiple tries since I already spent hours researching the topic. From these 5 problems, in 4 cases the AI told me solutions repeatedly which were entirely wrong (e.g. used hallucinated APIs, provided entirely false or very outdated answers), and when I pointed this out and tried to nudge it for a better answer it flat out said that what I am looking to do is impossible. I think my job safety is great, as I managed to achieve all these 4 ""impossible"" tasks, and none of them were hacks, the AI was just wrong. The in the fifth case it provided also wrong answers, but its wrong answer showed an API which lead me to a part of the documentation where I later found the bits I constructed the working solution from.

A new colleague uses AI a lot, and turns in bad PRs. I spoke with him and it turns out it is as AI recalls wrong and outdated answers, and instead suggests or at least leads the guy to bad and hacky solutions. This is because the good solutions are not documented well, or at all, or the wrong / outdated solution is overrepresented, or old answers state that X is not possible, which was true in 2007 but not anymore.

So what I am saying is that in my case for example I do not benefit much from AI. The best usecase it gives me is when I need to work with a new programming language, as it knows the basics fine. But after the initial period it is not very useful for me.

I think it is possible, that many who are in charge at Apple might also work with complex stuff, and fail to see the benefit of AI. Despite it having benefits if you know much less or have simple questions. On bright side it seems my job is quite safe for now.",

Apple's strategy to go for small on-device AI features instead of just streaming everything to a big server in a datacenter is not yet paying off. But who's AI is paying off right now? The peak of what AI can do is very interesting, but also very expensive. A lot of the cutting edge features require 200$ a month pro subscriptions, but I expect 95% of people yearning for AI features not willing to pay even 20$ in a subscription.

All this stemmed from the fact that he couldn't fire him as he was a ""star hire"" so it would make apple look stupid if they were hired and fired quickly because one executive/employee disagreed with their vision.",

"I've sworn off Apple products since around 2015 or so, but one of my jobs bought me an M2 MacBook Air to mostly get on the same software as everyone else.

Also whenever I have an external display plugged in to the laptop and close the laptop before unplugging the display cable (easy to do) the menu bar freaks out and I have to restart the entire computer to access the menu bar again. That's just like the most common bullshit, but everything about the iOS experience has been frustrating and terrible.

Stealing I mean borrowing something from another is Apple like,
"I think Apple should stick to their high quality standards and DON'T rush into releasing half baked LLM AI stuff, that doesn't really work that well, just because everyone else has been doing it. ChatGPT, Copilot and Gemini are useful for some cases, like summarizing text or detecting patterns in images. But they are definitely not the all round personal assistant that their marketing teams advertise them as. Copilot will generate you a cooking recipe with lethally toxic ingredients. ChatGPT will generate travel plans that only work if you have teleportation available as a mode of transport and Gemini will generate an instruction manual for a device, by just mashing together multiple totally different device's user manuals. Ohh and all three tend to just make up fantasy stuff if they don't know an answer to your question.
At the current mid 2025 stage, I see this technology (AI natural language prompts and chats) as mostly a helper to Googling. Because they are indeed faster to find keywords than you are as a human. But they also make more mistakes than you, as a human :)

More specialized use cases do work really really well though. One of the few Apple Intelligence features already released to EU customers, is the pattern recognition feature for the iPhone gallery app. If I take a photo of a leaf, an insect, a landmark etc. it will give me a subtle button to determine what it is that I have just photographed. And this feature does work. It's not bleeding edge technology anymore. But it's polished.",
"I'm sorry, but you made me laugh out loud while at work listening to you say @ 4:44 ""not only did apple arrive late, it showed up empty handed and borrowed someone else's tools, not very apple like.""

"I hate to tell you but your so completely wrong about this. 

Apples costumers value privacy, security, and ease of use. You absolutely cannot provide customers on device generative ai at any affordable cost. This is because of the unpresidented amount of dedicated cloud storage it would require to keep customers interactions with their on device chatbot secure and private. And that's in the most basic terms. The storage space for that amount of data would be well over a terabyte after probably 20 questions or tasks!! Plus the consumer would need to train the chatbot on their own. People dont want to do that! They want a chatbot pretrained, and ready to go! To provide that, Apple would be forced to partner with a company already doing that. A company that's been traing their chatbot from the limited amounts of free internet content. Content thats not copy written, not trademarked and content you dont have to pay for.  The same company will also have the servers dedicated to keep the conversation transcripts of peoples conversations with the chatbot for future training of said chatbot. We are talking shitloads of data space! Personally I don't think we have the infrastructure to even come close to housing it offline. It'll all be stored online, and it will out data any and all quality content on the internet. 

To Apple this is a privacy and security nightmare! And rightfully so! I'm proud of apple for thinking in these next step terms. They do it because they want to make a profit first but they also do it because they want to get tech right, the first time. Unlike Microsoft  with literal shit software, constant security patches,  constant attacks, and numerous dataleaks.  Who even knows who has access to those chatbot transcripts? Who can read them? Who are they being sold to? No one fucking knows! Thats not a good selling point for Apple, or fundamentally any company. PLUS, in order to have a chatbot via a third party youll need a constant internet connection. Which is also a privacy and security threat. 

Apple isnt lagging behind. They are trying to prepare for the AGI immersive future experice that will render ai chatbots on the same level with fm radio. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… Apple isnt in the business of risk, its in the business of furture tech.",

"There's no denying that Apple is not having its best days, but it's not the chaos that some are preaching. I've been an Android user for a long time and I recently got to test iOS. The first thing you notice is that something seems to be missing, especially for Galaxy users, but you also realize that the device simply works and that it will last for a long time. iOS allows you to install preliminary and therefore unstable versions for testing, and these grotesque bugs are probably due to this scenario.

As for AI, they promised a lot and didn't deliver anything. Their mistake was not admitting that it wasn't their focus and not trying to integrate ChatGPT from the beginning. Google also went into crisis when ChatGPT was launched, but as a company focused exclusively on software and with the largest database in the world, it didn't take long to recover.",

How about designing a  programming tool for little or huge games on the Iphone and Ipad? How about designing a literal Sandbox for Appple Vision?

With rewards along the way that make children love it.That all could use specialized AI in the background to make it magic. What they sold was the generalistic positronic brain that tries to replace humans while it is struggling to reason on the same level as a 2 year old toddler.

"Siri has NEVER worked well. I went through a phase where I just stopped using it and associated it with anger. Only reason I use it now is because of HUE lights.

"It's to easy to say Steve would have never let it get to this point. He had his failed products too. But he did understand what a good product was and what it should be or could do. The real problem is actually Tim Cook. Software is entering a time when large AI models full integration. Tim is a bean counter and not a visionary. The products like services, watch, airpods are all far more easy to bring to market then AI because it's so dynamic. This is possibly Apples Nokia moment of missing the boat. While they always are never first to the game, In this case with how fast paced AI is, they don't have a way to catch up now. The only way they can salvage this is probably to do a deal with Google for Gemini support and use Siri as the gatekeeper. This idea isn't so crazy as it offloads development and Google already pay Apple to have Google search as default on safari. But long story short, they are to late so a new approach is needed.",
I thought apple is super behind since Galaxy S3.. let alone Xiami 15 Ultra. Apple has been over for 5 years already it'll just take the mob a long time to realise.,
There is a striking parallel here with how Microsoft lost its dominance by being late in the arrival of the smartphone. I feel Apple will start to lose its marketing position fast. Worse over is that being in their walled garden has lost its luster. Its no longer a 'hip'  thing and the quality is dropping while innovation is falling behind. It remains to be seen who will take over as I am not certain whether it will be OpenAI for instance but we will see.,
Now they make the UI translucent so we can't see the mess anymore.,

"I would never invest in Apple at the current price/earnings level.  It's clear this is a not a well-run company anymore, if it ever was.  There is clearly a very bad culture there with some really bad people in high positions, and if a company is rotten it usually comes from the man at the top.    Apple has a higher P/E than Google!   Google which is constantly inventing and shipping revolutionary products! Google which has the best AI models.   But the P/E suggests that Apple has more growth potential than Google?!?!",

"Think it all depends on what kind of lessons Apple really learns from this (if any), and how they end up actually applying it. Going by their track record, there's a greater than typical chance that the hit will ultimately be very moderate: Apple's greatest success is in many ways not actually selling devices, it's selling head canon. That puts them in a different league of ability to redirect, deflect and respin narratives.",
â€œAI for the rest of usâ€ is such a bad tagline as well,
"Really liked the comics stylization. Really helps understand what is being told. Good stuff.

"The old strategy could work if one is innovative, which Apple has been anything but for the past decade. But now, with how fast AI is changing, they need to be innovative and quick. They're now two steps off their usual strategy. And let's be real, Tim is not fit for that. He's the production guy, Steve was the innovator. Tim was the right guy to keep the machine well oiled and running when Steve left, but now the machine is no longer relevant with the current landscape. And Steve made Jony the face of innovation to give the people something to look forward to. Under Tim, there's no face doing that part, which is why they seem stale.",

Apple has lost its mojo since Steve Jobs died. Nothing exciting comes out of Apple since.,
"Nice video. But what you say about internal fighting, going around people's backs. having two teams competing for the same thing, etc. may sound worse the way you say it than reality. Apple is not a company where people are supposed to just do what they're told, it's a place where you're expected to do what you believe is great work. If other people don't share your ideas, you try to convince them, even if they are your seniors. It's constantly emphasised to connect and collaborate with people all around the company to help you achieve your vision. Apple is not built on lines of command, but on ""tumbling rocks"" and striving to get the best through a lot of convincing, prototyping, competition, etc. Having two departments compete to do the same thing in a different way is not an anomaly, and it's not seen as a bad thing necessarily. Two teams with different visions can just work very hard to realize their ideal and then we can see which idea was best in the end. That's better than the two teams working together on a poor compromise that doesn't achieve any of the ideals that either imagined. Apple might seem like a well structured company on the outside, but it has always been messy on the inside, and that's how it's meant to be, by Steve Jobs' design when he rejoined.",
Is Apple going to be the next Nokia?,
If it's iA apple would have nailed.,
Crapple,
The notification on Tucker Carlson actually sounds believable,
this is because AI was over hyped and still is over hyped by the Finance Industry. Ask any person who actually works on the technical side of AI and they will tell you that what the Finace Industry says is so removed from reality. Apple caused this problem because of their need to appease the Financial people in Apple (in my opinion).,

Even so, I don't give a damn about Apple Intelligence and won't be setting it up on my new iPhone or any of my Apple Silicon Macs, and MKBHD was right about how the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max felt very incomplete on launch, as they were advertised with AI features that flat-out weren't ready yet.",

"the apple paper was an absolute train wreck. it spoke of the obvious but as if apple somehow made a new discovery, but it was only a move to discourage the development of AI and justify their lack of incentives for improving their own software products. they had checked out after seeing the failures they made and by how much the opponents had left them behind. it was a good strategic move, but the execution wasn't very much confusing, especially when people can visibly and in real-time observe the progress of technology and the new breakthroughs that people make with AI technologies, in a matter of weeks, and regularly.

we're living in a crazy time. if that becomes overwhelming as it naturally will, it's okay to say ""i want out."" the mistake is when you starts trying to make excuses for it. that's when you start becoming dishonest, and people will out you for it. if you want out, let the truth out.

"I don't know where this idea that apple is famous for great software (and have now failed unexpectedly ) comes from. I think this is marketing created perception overwriting history. If one re-thinks this  (IMO wrong) assumption it all suddenly makes sense. Apple has historically had great hardware, no argument there. (although u can argue It's the same value per buck than other manufacturers) But you have apple Silicon ðŸ‘ impressive. The build quality and technical achievements of the Johny Ives era of devices ðŸ‘Œgreat. But at the same time, on the software side this was going on: Incompatible Software, plagued with unending spinners of loading death on the early 2000s, the first Iphones had cameras but couldn't do video ðŸ˜† when all competitors could. Siri! was crap from the start, inmediately surpassed by google assistant. Apple Maps fiasco. Forced OS upgrades fiascos, Inflexible UIs, the iphone literally just got a customizable home screen a couple years back. Don't even talk about safari. I think is fair to say: Once again apple has failed at software in spite of having better hardware and a closed ecosystem. Is just how it is. If you really think about it, most famous apple software is third-party software (like final cut) showing that even the independent devs can do more with the advantages of a closed ecosystem than apple themselves can. The only piece of software that I think of as famously good apple software is AirDrop, but while is technically software it heavily relies on the hardware of the ecosystem. Which is probably the only reason they are still holding that ground. I have used Apple products in spite of their software historically , not because of it.",

"They spent 10 bn over like 10 years to build a self driving car until they finally admitted that it can't be done (while Tesla is still fishing investor gold with this method) and scrapped it to focus more resources on AI. The failure of Siri to improve is probably created by the opportunity costs of this car. On that note, I am using the Google in my house and it's arguably every bit as bad as Siri. It almost feels like it was better in 2018 when I first installed the system. It's really time to just make even the smallest of Gemini models the engine that creates the interaction. The crappiness of these voice assistants is just unacceptable in times when we have near-magic AI already accessible free for all. I never tried Alexa so I can't judge that one.",

"Appleâ€™s main challenge today is the absence of Steve Jobsâ€™ visionary leadership, which drove its most groundbreaking innovations. The company has largely relied on products invented over a decade ago, like the iPhone, with recent models seen as incremental rather than revolutionary compared to competitors. Despite heavy investment in R&D and advances in custom silicon, AI, and AR/VR, Appleâ€™s new innovations have yet to match the impact of the Jobs era. Nonetheless, the strong brand legacy built by Jobs continues to sustain Appleâ€™s market dominance and customer loyalty, though there is increasing pressure for the company to regain its reputation as a true innovation leader. Having used iPhones from the 3 all the way up to the 13, Iâ€™m seriously considering making the switch to Google for my next phone, cause SIRI is seriously.... ancient.",

Apple warned us in 2023 - they said that forcing Apple to use USB-C instead of their proprietry lightning charger would 'stifle innovation'. So we can't really blame Apple for the lack of innovation in recent years. It's not their fault this was forced upon them.,

Personally I don't even use Gemini or ChatGPT much every day but only on certain occasions when I need help from AI. I think AI is just overly hyped.

Iâ€™ve been using generative AI since long before 99% of people even knew what that was, much less had been give the opportunity to use yet. It largely is just a gimmick, and Apple doesnâ€™t really wanna implement gimmicks (particularly if they violate authenticity). Thatâ€™s my take.

"Time, it appears, is circular in the Tech sphere. Apple hired John Sculley to be its CEO, the former head of Pepsi ""Sugar-Water"" , he came from a dramatically different CULTURE and drove the company off a cliff. Apple righted the ship and re-hired Jobs, learning a valuable lesson in following its OWN culture. Seems the same thing happened again in hiring this Amazon exec, only to be secretly undercut by Jobs loyalists. Culture lesson learned, direction re-established, Apple can once again forge into the future, on its own terms.",

So, Apple Intelligence came out...kind of.  The thing is, they missed the ball probably because they don't really care about their userbase beyond coming out with another phone just like the previous one, but whose number is one higher, and cost is a little higher.",
Steve Jobs would've initiated a Stalin level purge of the company if he took one look at modern iOS,
"Apple missed foldables, messed VR glasses, they shamefully leech from payments made by and to others in their phones, and now they missed AI. Looks like a sinking ship!",

"You are wrong about it not working. Please cite your sources instead of pulling out of your arse and otherwise say it as is, that all this â€œinfoâ€ is just simply rumors",
All this started after Steve Jobs passed the reins over to Tim Cook who is not a visionary and does not have the passion for innovation and technology.  He is only interested in marketing and sales numbers.  It's just a matter of time before Apple becomes a byword in the history books ...,
this video could've been 5 minutes long,
Siri was always a joke. Itâ€™s so bad now I canâ€™t get any answers out of her for basic questions.,
The appropriate background footage here would be Gavin Belson from the Silicon Valley TV show just completely trashing his Mansion with his bare hands.,
"Not to defend Apple but it must be very difficult to keep that company running as its been for decades and always remaining a leader. They were able to go beyond the typical model of the 90s PC maker by innovating in other segments like phones, something that Microsoft, Dell, Compaq, or even Japanese Giants didn't achieve.
So, to satisfy investors and show that they can keep bringing the money, they have to make attempts in new segments, which unfortunately rarely greatly succeeded or just completely. The Apple Car and the Vision Pro are 2 good recent example. These projects haven taken away valuable resources that could have been allocated to other things, such as GenAI. But still, who knew that ChatGPT was going to be a huge deal. Most probably not Apple, because fundamentally, it's a computer/device maker and they are incredibly good at it. In fact, meanwhile this flop is happening, Apple pulled out the Apple Silicon, which keeps beating the market.
So personally, I'm not really worried about Apple missing the AI boat because on the long term, it's not a big deal and they will eventually get on track.
Hopefully, they will shift their focus from useless designs that bring no life improvements to the users (rounded corners, notches, dynamic islands, glass looking UIs, etc.) and focus on what's really bringing value.",
"This video highlights that Apple is getting sued for false advertising, yet Tesla and that hot mess get away with promising things that literally never come out? Or promoting things that can literally KILL people?

Jobs could see the gaps in current technology and fill it by getting brilliant people work as hard as they could. Not with the whip, but with the vision of a few people changing the world. On the other hand he was always willing to give in if someone else did it better: When USB got great, he immediately dropped his own propriatary connection standard. When Intel overtook Motorola, he changed to Intel, aimed at optimizing the user experience. Back then that was about performance. Today performance is not really the issue. Its about a desireable ecosystem. Does the Iphone have an age related modifier to nudge children into thinking? How about helping them doing homework by explaining step by step until they are able to solve it themselves? With little rewards along the way, so children love to use it. How about a course for getting over procrastination? With little rewards to love users doing it! How about real games, that deserve the name intstead of industrialized money pits that are designed to make you loose time and money in the dumbest ways?

You know who aren't complaining? Chinese with some of the best products from the last 5 years in a roll, best EV cars, best smartphones, best laptops, guess why? They hire the best!

Hiring the best one for the job was a common knowledge from the start of humanity, but know sounds offensive to say it out of loud.",
Tim Cook and the other execs are too used to just counting the  billions rolling in.,
Steve Jobs would have never let AI slipped like that.,"Steve Jobs had the good luck of dying while he was only a bit past his prime and still relevant. Had he lived longer, he would have been an old, tired joke by now - like Musk or any other once successful man in a terminal mental decline. We are all mortals and we all have a mental expiration date, which usually precedes the date of death by many years."
"Apple literally jumped out of flying plane, hoping they would find a parachute on their way down.",
"Jobs was an engineer, visionary and an artist......The leadership after his passing are just engineers. Their cure for everything is to update and upgrade what is, without thinking outside the box (reimagining what is existing and envisioning what could be). In order to advance in technology, just having an engineer mentality only will get you to where Apple is today. Jobs envisioned Siri to do much more than what his engineer minded hacks had done with it since his death, and now it has caught up with the company.  Chat got snuck up on Apple because a lot of engineering visionaries and artists put a lot of input from different backgrounds....Apple, on the other hand, inbred group think, and never saw what came with chat got because they were so successful doing the unimaginative stuff...for awhile.....But now it has caught up with them.

We will see this fall if the beginning of the end of their dominance is upon us...",

"The problem is Apple keeps ignoring its customers regarding Siri and focuses on secondary gimmicks like Genmoji.
They tell us that the new Siri doesnâ€™t meet their quality expectations for release but theyâ€™re happy to continue with an existing product thatâ€™s frustrating to use at best and woefully inept at its worst. Siri canâ€™t even answer the most basic queries, meanwhile its competitors are years ahead in capability. 
Listening to Craig F et al recently, they seem either completely unaware or they just donâ€™t care what Apple customers want Siri to be: a useful, reliable, accurate personal assistant.","Also, they have the gall to artificially limit the Apple â€œintelligenceâ€ gimmicks to newer phones!

I think they cornered themselves when they made privacy the central part of their marketing. Now they are stuck running on device ai models instead of the cloud which are subpar. They also have a lot less data to feed the  models compared to the competition also because of their privacy policies. Those features should have never been announced as this was predictable.,

Not saying Apple Car was a great products, far from it, but the way they handled it based on info we have? Classic tale of what was quoted in this vid which is ""do more with less"" and at the same time expecting a completely new product and division handling it to start printing money way sooner than it was ever possible. Same with the Vision Pro, that thing was impressive from the perspective of tech and potential it had. But Apple never provided decent enough tools for developers to work in that ecosystem, never tried to get some major companies on board, and instead tried to market the product to... regular people? Headset that is at the end of the day not that comfortable and costs 3,5k USD for the most basic version with a laughable 256GB storage in it? 

It was all mismanagement, but it comes from the top. Short process cycles and money printing as soon as possbile. That philosophy rarely ever works."

95% of new features for iPhones and iOS are these days completely useless to me. Gimmicks. I spend more time in figuring out how to disable those new nonsense features on my phone than using those 5% features that at least seem to have some use cases on paper. Apple focuses too much on new designs than on new features. Reminds me of all those redesigns of webpages, shops and portals during my past years in the job. With every new boss there was a redesign. Because changing the look and feel is the easiest way to show that someone did something without actually doing something.

Every single app has a different way of dealing with the keyboard, I mean on android thereâ€™s a â€œhide keyboardâ€œ button. On iOS you have to use that stupid gesture that works differently on every single app or donâ€™t even work at all. The keyboard itself sucks, no numbers on the main keyboard, no clipboard, prediction is horrible in my language, you canâ€™t even change the size.

The settings are all over the place, it took me 30min and a Reddit post to finally found â€œauto brightnessâ€œ which is in the accessibility settings and not inside the brightness settings for some reasons. (Not even in the control center)

Why do I have to swipe when faceid sees me, just unlock the phone already. Speaking about faceid, it works great but I donâ€™t need to see that useless lock icon animation every time I use it. 

No universal back gesture, some app allow it some donâ€™t. 

90% of the time when I use the back gesture on safari to go to the previous page, nothing load and I have to start all over again. 

You canâ€™t even change your ringtone without having to almost hack the phone, just let me download a song from YouTube and set it as a ringtone. 

Customization is basically changing the colors of the icons and the wallpaper. Incredible ðŸ˜.

Why is there so much wasted space between the dock and the first row of icons?

If I donâ€™t need the widget â€œpageâ€œ on my home screen, I mean the one on the left side, just let me delete it. 

Swiping down for the control center works smoothly but not the notification screen. 

The cameras are not good at all, itâ€™s only decent because apps are optimized for iPhone. But if you look at the raw picture of an iPhone against any Android flagship, the iPhone one looks like shit. 

iPhones users always say that I will get use to it, but to me itâ€™s like punching someone in the face until he likes it.

Google should also be sued for false advertising since everything included in their devices is not ""included"" per se, it requires accepting a privacy agreement because it needs to send data to Google.

If users expect it to match or outperform cloud-based models with over 600 billion parameters, that's unrealistic â€” mobile chips just aren't there yet.","Apple cannot run AI in the cloud, it doesn't have a cloud for that, hence trying run it on the phone as if they respect your privacy."

"Nonsense video, basically all you're saying is ""last year didn't work, competition was here before"" - Apple is way behind on real world application of AI, but opening models to developers and running them locally is huge, huge benefit to devs. You're observing WWDC as if it's an iphone keynote launch from 15 years ago and pushing out content with effectively no information at all",
"there's nothing wrong in having two AI teams â€” google has multiple, that's why their models are all over the place and you can see it's clearly different products under one umbrella. they are all made separately as to not put all eggs in one basket",

"They should've silently cancelled it then at WWDC address the rumors and say ""no, we're not making an AI model because machines aren't our customers. You are. You, the creative minds that made us who we are."" They would've gotten so much positive praise for that. But no, they chased the shareholders and the AI bubble, and are now paying the price for it since they fumbled the bag so hard","I've mentally thought about everything else Apple could have done or not done since end 2024. Never considered that, this is so true! This would have made their stock go down maybe but hardcore loyalist would easily have paid the difference, and for once, with good reasons. Example? When somebody from the us copyright office said something against an ai company in an ongoing lawsuit from a magazine for copyright infringment  Trump just fired that person. Apple, if it's the end for them soon, made their last big mistake last year. Vision was maybe a commercial failure but still technical achievement and 256gb for that price is just a real shame whether you're apple or not. Time will tell how it all goes."

"ironically, one of Apple's two  innovation over the last 10-15 years was the Vision VR which failed massively. The other one being their silicon and ARM adaptation - which rocks.

I think they intended to be a bit more successful in popularity with the vision, but the product stopped existing 2 weeks after release in the general public. Meanwhile the term ipod is still used for mp3 players.
I've never liked apple but the products of the 2000s were amazing for the average consumer. but after the Iphone 5, they sat down and did nothing.

They tried to implement LLM's but couldn't get it to meet Apple's standards for performance and consistency. Idk just based on Apple's history, resources, talent, etc. I'm not sure I buy ""well they're just too dumb to figure out Ai.""

I dont even think it's reasonable to assume LLM's are the future of Ai since they're just the first really usable versions of this. But I do think that all the companies involved are trying to milk LLM's for all their worth until then.",

"apple doesn't learn from past mistakes, it has been shipping shit products for ever, do we notice because we are used to perfection or do other companies do the same ?

"4:43 ""Not only did Apple show up late, but it showed up late and borrowed other people's tools. Not very Apple like"" - Actually, that's VERY much like Apple. They take other tech and 'prettify' it. Rarely do they truly innovate the tech.  They copy.  That's why they're often late. It takes time for new tech to mature and for them to copy it. They also 'borrowed':
* The GUI (from Xerox, 11 years late) 
* The Mouse (also from Xerox, 16 years late), 
* Smartphone (5 years late), 
* Tablets (10 yeaars late), 
* Voice assistant (3 years late),
* Bluetooth wireless Earbuds (9 years late),
* Mobile payments (3 years late),
* Smart watches (3 years late),
* MP3 players (4 years late). 

Not saying they don't do a great job at it. They're attacking it from a consumer design & usability POV But let's not pretend it's always on the cutting edge of innovation. It's their marketing department who fools the Apple fanboys into thinking they are. They piss on them, and tell them it's raining (see Apple Intelligence).","They practically use their competitors as R&D then talk up the ""new"" product through the marketing budget that dwarfs a small nation's GDP."

Of course privacy in todayâ€™s world is an illusion, but ï£¿ strives to hold onto that as a marketing pitch rather than doing what other companies do which is blur the line and distract with features that outplay any notion of privacy. So, I think what weâ€™ll see going forward is ï£¿ finally capitulating to save face and save share holders, ultimately becoming something that Steve Jobs never wanted, but must become in order to compete. Either that, or the era of ï£¿ is over. Weâ€™ll see.",

They want us to believe that the LLM figured it out. Absolutely not. It was all hand-trained to perfection and algorithms were custom written behind the scenes. LLMs were used to understand what the user wanted and to produce the final answer. But everything else is hand-trained. And that is why it will be very difficult for anybody to replicate.",

Appleâ€™s taking its time with AI, weaving it into their ecosystem in a unique way no one else is doing. Thatâ€™s why progress feels slow; theyâ€™re redefining the game. YouTubeâ€™s flooded with bandwagon negativity, predicting Appleâ€™s doom, just like they did with Googleâ€™s search or AirPods (remember the Q-tip jabs?). These giants are too big to failâ€”they hire the worldâ€™s brightest minds to innovate. Most opinions just parrot branding and marketing hype, and the masses follow like sheep. Mark my words: Appleâ€™s AI will deliver unmatched experiences, and their stock will hit $240â€“$270 within 3 years. Keep up the awesome content! Iâ€™m a Samsung user but own some Apple productsâ€”not affiliated with them. Just my opinions, not financial advice. ( GREAT FK VIDEO AS ALWAYS }",

IDK if Apple will ever recover. The only tech they released that was awesome was the M-Chips. Other than that I don't even watch WWDC or keynotes anymore. Steve made those keynotes fun.",

A rare failure? How about their EV? Apple are going the way of Nokia IMHO.,
I really want apple  fall down so other brands stop making their products like Apple products,
Hard disagree - Most AI in the market is still extremely buggy beyond the vanilla use cases. Its a limitation of the technology.,
Nice AI video,
Apple should train a model on Steve Jobs and ask AI Jobs for directions ðŸ˜…,
My view early on was steve jobs wouldnt of allowed these failures he ruled apple with an iron first and no nonsense attitude apple was his baby as far as he was concerned and no one wad to threaten it with him gona things have failed to innovate and im not an apple fan im windows and android but from what i know about apple steve jobs was who made apple what it is,
They should have not gone down the rabbit hole on performative AI. It should have all been backend improvements to existing on device services.  Health.  Calendar.  Journal. Siri.  We don't need image search or generation.  We never did.  They wasted a year and so much social capital by trying to keep up with gimmicks.,

"The Great Ensloppening is well underway, it's not just Apple software. Many engineers specialize on a very high level and simply lack knowledge of fundamentals related to CPU architecture and how computers actually execute commands and perform effectively. Product teams are constantly adding completely superfluous features driven purely by financial incentives, which in turn of course adds needless complexity, and most engineers don't stay on a project longer than a few years, so ownership is missing as well.

Rare failure?  It's not a stretch to consider the company's offerings as 3 big hits interrupting a 4 straight decade run of failure,
Too early to tell anything still,
Apple excelled when they did less things but very well. They have grown very big. The Siri/assistant/AI part was always a difficult point for them that they never addressed properly.

"Why is this such a surprise? Apple's specialty is making phones, not training AI. They lack the domain expertise to develop AI.

Massive fail,

"There are certain things about this video, that are incorrect. Firstly, other than certain specific features like on screen, awareness, and personal context, other features of Apple Intelligence like image playground, Genmoji, writing tools, ChatGPT integration, and other such features have been released and users are using it. Itâ€™s possible that some users may not like the features, but the features are out there. So it is not the case that Apple Intelligence has not been launched at all. Certain specific features of Apple Intelligence have been delayed because Apple would rather publish a product which serves its purpose, rather than publish something that makes users even more dissatisfied. Secondly, in WWDC 2025, Apple has never said that the remaining features of Apple Intelligence like on screen awareness and personal context are coming this fall. Do not spread misinformation.
Thirdly, Apple, unlike open AI, Google, is not an AI company. Apple is not expected to launch another chat, bot, ChatGPT, or Gemini, or copilot. It is expected to integrate AI into its product experience in a way that makes the experience better. Another chat bot is not an expectation out of Apple. The degree of expectation from Apple is largely different, compared to what people have from Google. The video is informative, but definitely and undoubtedly, misleading.",
"18:47 bruh, who edited this?",
"Elon has been selling full self driving ""available next year"" for nearly 10 years for Tesla.",
It's the downfall of Apple,
"Problem with all tech companies it seem is that they lack direction and a unified vision. As much as I dislike both Apple and Steve Jobs, having a single person with an actual vision direct things over a long period of time actually works. Getting new people in to work on this or that money making scheme then replacing them when they fail doesn't work. Google and it's graveyard products is a prime example of this, it could have been so much more than it is if it had stuck with and refined some of the products they axed and turned them into a cohesive ecosystem. Even YouTube, arguably one of their most valuable products are suffering from their failure to turn it into more than an ad funded video hosting service because of this. This is what happens when you're always catering to investors and as a result hire incompetent CEO's only to fire them and hire someone else equally incompetent after a few years. It's not even that they're necessarily bad CEO's, they might be good at whatever that means, but they're not the vision people. What is considered a good CEO in most circles have a vision and plan for money in investor pockets, not products in consumer pockets, not a grand vision for the future they want to see, a future that is marketable, because they don't have imagination. Remember, Steve Jobs was not a tech guy, he was primarily a designer, an art guy. If your company is not being run by a dreamer you're not going to dream up new cool stuff. And if you have a dreamer but only let them stay for a couple of years because they weren't immediately profitable, you just end up like Google, fractured and scattered all over the place with no direction. It's the same issue you see with a lot of democratic counties. Someone comes in, tries to do a bunch of good stuff, few years later someone else comes in a think that stuff sucks and ends it all in favour of a bunch of other also good stuff, then again and again, so nothing gets to mature and there is no unified vision or direction or prolonged effort. Not that I'm against democracy, but it a highly inefficient and slow way to make progress that often takes one step forward and two back and even on it's best days take two steps forward and one back. But when it comes to running a civilization slow and steady might yet win the race. The same is not true in the setting of a corporation, you can't do that there unless you want to get left behind and inevitably replaced by someone that does have a vision. Essentially the main problem is when the goal becomes profit, rather than profit being a side effect of someone reaching for a greater vision, a unified and coherent long term plan to great something great for the sake of it. If your imagination only extends to ""I think people will buy this"" you're doing it wrong, it needs to be ""I think this will make the world a better place"".",
Iâ€™m not that big of a fan of the first minute of this video. Showing screenshots from a development beta where itâ€™s expected to be riddled with bugs and far from finished to get your point across leaves a sour taste. That being said Apple AI was and still is a desaster - especially it being one of main selling points for the iPhone 16 last year and then underdelivering in every aspect possible.,
Rotting Apple? ðŸ,
"It's ok , we don't need AI everywhere",I feel sorry for you not knowing how or when to use superior tools.
"I hope this isn't a paid promotion for Gemini, because I use that for a couple weeks and switch back to chat gbt because while it's not integrated, it's smarter",
"I'm going to go out on a limb and say Apple saw that it was a bubble, waited for it to pop and be able to say ""yeah we figured that from the start"". There's a reason there's no WEB3 blockchain garbage in your iPhone. Moreover, most people just don't want AI in all of their shit and they likely know it. It's mostly investors that are making this huge push.",
It's a mess. What they need is Tim Cook intervening and overseeing it properly - integrate the features already in AI - the software and the technology - you simply have to integrate - ITS NOT THAT HARD - improve Siri to make it like ChatGPT chat bot and voice chat- It already exists - modify it to be more apple like - and there you have it - the technology already exists - how can it be so hard?,
"Talk about a ""bump"" in the road: Jobs would not (and I do not either) accept the bloody bulge of a camera on the iphone! It is a serious ugliness that was always not Apple. Now it is. Crap!",

"Steve Jobs was a huge asshole but yeah none of this would fly under his leadership. Tim Cook isnâ€™t a creative, heâ€™s a numbers and logistics guy. Once Steve died innovation died and the new products that came out were things that were most likely technology that was being worked on while Steve was alive. People need to remember that new technology takes a decade or more to be created more times than not.",
TLDR: mkbhd is a corpo shill and apple intelligence is a scam,
"I dont use apple, so i wasnt aware  they had this issue, and I was planning to buy my dad a brand new iphone for christmas since the current one wasnt compatible with their AI features, good to know!",
"Wokness is starting to hit Apple hard, very hard. When the sexual preference of people is more of important than your own business, this happens.",
Tell them to dig a hole and not giving them a shovel,
Does this matter though? it doesn't because Apple isn't a tech company anymore. It's a fashion brand.  It thrives off of the public perception of Apple products = rich. That's where they won ground over android. Android can be the best thing since sliced bread but it doesn't have the image that apple gives off.,
AI hype took a big bite out of the Apple,
Apple's approach to Data Privacy and Security is why Apple will never be at the top of AI race. it simply has no data.,"Even small companies made some amazing models using only open data, and with a fraction of what Apple invested in this. Everyone at Apple is just incompetent."
"Intrigues between apple teams developing basically the same product? Sounds like Lisa and Macintosh all over again... Only this time, none of it seems to work",
"I heard it's like an internal company people problem they got with their AI, also AI is still at it's infancy. I'm seeing news that about how much lawsuits there are against AI developers. them big companies really are getting mad that their IP is being used to train AI image generation",
"This is what happens when you let a man with no vision take over from a man who was a visionary. Steve Jobs wasn't the genius they all credited him to be, but he was definitely a visionary for Apple. This new guy, Tim Apple LOL, he sucks. He is guaranteed that apple is going back down the path it was on before jobs returned.",
"I never thought I would, but since it was turned on in my phone I've been using Gemini a lot. I was blown away by the fact that it could even play a whole board game with me by describing it's moves for me to physically manipulate on the board.",
No one from Apple is even qualified to talk about AI or intelligence in general. These people have been failing at everything they do (except the M-series chips) for at least a decade now.,
"""apple"" intelligence is a very fitting name for this disaster. And this whole situation is very reminiscent of Apple's dark days in the mid 1990s.",
Apple as a tech company has died if you are living under a rock now it is a lifestyle and finance company.,
Unnovation time,
Apple might be the next Nokia and Blackberry,
Stop every thing! Spaceballs 2 was just announced. The quest for more money.,
Who buys phone for AI? Who buys phone for camera? Phone lost its true purpose.,
"I can understand why a subset of the consumer base is upset over Apple Intelligence, but most of us couldnâ€™t care any less about it. AI is not something we ever really wanted. All we want is Siri to be slightly more useful.","You don't want AI, but you want a more competent AI..."

"Incompetence fulled by ""trust fund"" syndrome. No one at apple, other than the Silicon team, is compentent, and in position of leadership due to merit and execution. Apple TV+ losses $1B a year but there's a new F1 movie out with Brad pit? WTF? Why is apple producing movies and TV? It's ego that is funded by the legacy of Jobs/Ivy. 

The board and Tim cook should be removed with a shareholder movement (I'm a smaller shareholder)",
Current Apple is what happens when you put more money and focus on the marketing team instead of tech & innovation.,
Timâ€™s cooked,
"Apple is the only one treating AI responsibly. There is no disaster, just another tech bubble that everyone is riding that they will promptly pretend they weren't riding when it finally fails spectacularly.","Is this a joke? Apple is just not competent enough to even enter the AI race, it has nothing to do with responsibility..."
no wonder apple is now only doing virtual announcement instead of live,
"Apple sucks ass, fans have just convinced themselves it's a status symbol",
Google and chatgpt should offer white label AI services.....Apple can the put their lable as Apple Intelligence just like Copilot did,
"I have only used assistant for meetings and alarms, anything else, is 100% (real) AI for me",

"Yeah, Siri has gotten worse and worse",
"Apple's problem on this one is they were late to the party, and because of the advancement speed of AI as a technology, by the time they noticed they were too far behind to play catch up from 0, so they partnered with another company (Open AI) and rushed the tech to market so that they wouldn't get left any further behind, but this is the opposite of what they normally do. Apple is one of the only technology companies that don't release MVP's to the public, and almost everything Apple is closed source, meaning they maintain control over not only ownership, but quality assurance too. The truth is the part they did, plugging OpenAI into their system works flawlessly, but the integration is only as good as the data going in, and in this case as we know, AI has some awkward and clunky aspects, such as misinterpreting tone and hallucinating.",
"They have trillion dollar in their pockets but they don't want to steal ai engineers from Google or open ai by offering them attractive salary package, that's weird, from when corporates start follow morals?",
"I would never ever buy any apple product , it is outdated and always problematic",
Whatever happens don't wear battery on your eyes.,
Apple intelligence works perfectly on my phone with Apple Intelligence. I donâ€™t know what you haters are talking about.,
So their are going Vista with their new design?,
The original Siri was amazing. Now it's just a talking web search. Why the change?,
Apple may be right about AI not being truly intelligent but that doesnâ€™t excuse them from having the worst AI product in their lineup.,

"The joke is. I am running iOS26 dev beta. It is terrible! I am not talking about the many bugs, terribly high battery usage, heating up my phone or the many crashes and apps not working. Those are bugs hopefully fixed in future beta's. I am talking about Liquid Glass. It is TERRIBLE. It looks very strange and ugly. I wish I never updated to iOS26. I can't wait to move to an android phone again after this. The design does not fit anything on the phone. Notifications look weird and half the time things are unreadable. I am 34 and I have perfect eye sight. Still things just don't blend well at many times and if you look at side by sides between iOS 18 and iOS 26 many would have thought iOS 18 was the upgrade.",
I genuinely believe that they used Covid as a scapegoat to get out of doing live demos and hands on. And as a result they figured they can just fake everything and here we are now.,
"Showing beta iOS 26 is crazy, they will fix that, full version only coming out in September lol",That too dev beta not even public beta
Absolutely not sam altman and his team. It was ilya mostly and sa shouldve been ousted right then and there.,
"I much prefer Siri over gemini live. If I wanted a chatbot I would download an app. I want an assistant to check weather, send messages, pause or play my stuff, and get stuff done, not give me AI slop. I disabled all Apple Intelligence features too.

I dont need AI to write to my family (I actually love them), I don't need AI to send my email. This is thing my brain does because I still have one. If you dont use it you loose it. These AI features are only for investors. I actually like apple's approach more than Googles who went all in on it.",
Part of Apple's identity is a tightly controlled product design and user experience. Generative AI conflicts with that due to its probabilistic nature.,
iOS 18 was only ugly because they saved all the good stuff for iOS 26. This video will become outdated very soon.,
"â€œTurned up late, and borrowed someone elseâ€™s tools. Not very apple like â€œ ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ thatâ€™s all Apple does, â€œborrowsâ€ or truthfully steals other companies tools and software,",

What are you saying? they spent full 1 year to create a theme ,
This is what happens when technology matures and growth comes from the marketing department not engineering.,
Itâ€™s the beginning of an end.,
I want to see fall of apple and nintendo ðŸ˜‰,
"Apple is so lazy usually that it waits for others to do most of the work. Then it comes later like it invented that feature. But AI isn't like that, Apple did it's usual and fell on it's face flat.",

At least they were men enough to admit it this time respect Apple,
Wow,
"I was around for the release of the original Siri and followed the news around the Siri team ever since, the moment I heard about Apple Intelligence I knew it was going to be a mess and I absolutely knew Siri wouldnâ€™t be able to access apps.

"Was I the only one who noticed other brands were given a lot more prominence in this year's WWDC? Tim wore Nike Airforces, there was a Ford super car and a porsche. I thought that wasn't very apple like...",
Apple gl(ass) is definetly a smokescreen to detract from the lack of big new features.,
overripen is so suitable for apple,
"I mean, I can't refute the facts - and it makes sense that Apple's executives would fracture without the cult of personality that was Jobs. Perhaps this part of Siri's ""failure"" will be a life lesson. If Federighi ends up salvaging Apple Intelligence, that will likely just fall under his purview going forward.
I still maintain that Apple doesn't want to do what everyone else is doing (aside from what we saw with the Google AI segment, that's exactly part of what Apple is going for). I believe Apple is looking to make JARVIS, not a replacement for a person. Originally, I expected Siri to just *be* JARVIS. But I think the Siri brand has been so damaged that the plan now is to effectively ""dismantle"" Siri and implement the AI as a low level component within the OS, with Siri itself simply being a verbal element. I believe this is why we saw so much of Apple's keynote demonstrating the tight integration of targeted AI within apps.
For instance, I think we'll see Photos get the ability to use AI to devise dates images were taken based on the content of the photo - a great feature for families digitizing their great-grandmothers' photo albums. Or, the Health app collating health data with their fitness catalog to make even more targeted information. Couple that with (hopefully) Apple being able to get real-time glucose measurements out Apple Watch, and we could be looking at Apple letting the user know if they have the Dawn Effect and recommending a workout to help offset that early morning glucose spike. Or being able to collate sleep data with weight and heart data (instead of having dozens of individual metrics) - a ""hey, you lost 5 lbs, and in that time we noticed fewer sleep events, and your glucose remained in reasonable levels"" kind of thing.
This goes back to Jobs. There is no one at Apple who is the ""voice of the consumer"" the way Jobs was. No one to look at something and say ""what is the use case."" There is an infamous story about Jobs watching the Mac fire up for the first time, and the first thing he did was criticize the team for how the Mac took too long to start up -- that a customer shouldn't have to wait that long. no one at Apple is THAT person. It's a whole bunch of executives waiting for the marching orders that are not coming, especially since Tim Cook is an operations guy.
Forestall wanted to be THAT guy, but was a pain in the ass, forgetting you don't get to ACT like Steve Job at his worst until you can deliver the way Steve Jobs could. And perhaps maybe acting like Steve Jobs was something that should have just been left with Steve Jobs.
Cook needs to get his executives into a room, and pick one of the old guard - Federighi or Cue - to basically be the ""voice of the consumer"" and get the various teams focused and coordinated. This whole everyone is siloed thing is absurd when you have so many moving parts that need to all march on the same foot at the same time.",

Failure over and over. Apple are woke gender activists more obsessed with themselves than reality.,
"I am kind of in the camp that these internal apple people were ultimately right about AI being overvalued and not interesting. Their own internal research kind of proved that at the very least LLMs don't actually think. In my view the main issue here is the lack of confidence to either go all in on something or completely bet against it. They should have bet against traditional VR and gone all in on AR, but they didn't. They made another VR headset and failed. They should have bet against chatbots and focused purely on practical applications that work, but they didn't and they failed. I don't believe the AI hype, I think most of it is vaporware, but the others just do a better job of hiding it.","I agree. I think LLM-based AI is already stagnant. People just donâ€™t realize it yet because Google, OpenAI, Meta etc. Just keep finding new configurations that give the illusion of progress, because they produce results from the same tech simply we have not seen before. VO3â€™s speech output is a great example. Yes, itâ€™s better than what we had before. But thatâ€™s like saying â€˜paintâ€™ just got a huge upgrade when people figured out how to paint in photorealistic style. Itâ€™s impressive, but nothing about the technology itself has fundamentally improved, and there are only so many tricks you can teach these LLMâ€™s to be good at"

A rare failure? Apple has been taking Ls for years. They're a shell of what they used to be,
"Apart from the overpromising I don't see too much fault on Apples side.
Its true, they got a cold start due to internal troubles and indeed they play catchup in the generative AI base technology.

However the vision by Apple is not the technology, but what it enables. And this vision of a private, preferably local, fully-interconnected AI system with context of your private information has not been achived by anyone. Especially the private/local aspect.

Googles implementation of personal context heavily relies on the cloud, nothing local or private there.
All GenAI ChatBots (especially the good ones) heavily rely on the cloud as well. Except for Gemini none have access to personal context.

Additionally its not like gmail users or iPhone users were excluded from the advances in GenAI. Anyone could install Gemini, ChatGPT etc.
If it were just about building Siri into a simple Chatbot without context or actions it would not be so hard.",

Iâ€™ll guess try he apple fell to far from the ttreee,
"It is the accumulation of a company that builds very high walls to wall off a garden, stealing features from others, can't truly innovate, and rapes developers of 30% of their hard-earned funds, yet never offers 30% worth of updates. Their twice-a-year, Hollywood-polished videos are so predictable now that you don't even have to watch them to know precisely what they will say. They will have great zoom in introduction camera gimbles, someone will be standing on the roof and center garden of the campus building, someone will be on a hill overlooking the bay area, and they will talk about how much better this phones version of the camera is, how much faster apple silicon is and several new features they stole from Android OS or Samsung phones, while passing it off like it's theirs and that they are doing us a favor. Apple is a company filled with marketing genius, but light on outstanding engineers. It also appears their management is no longer top-notch.

"when you are the leader of sophisticated technology and arguably most desired company for consumer tech, any flaw or vulnerability will be enough to cause a big blast. LLMs are surely helpful, but does Samsung has one? nope. then why are people not targeting Samsung? simply because they're not the leaders, unlike Apple. Now with GPT and Google, GPT had the potential to dethrone google in terms of internet search, hence Google panicked and delivered Gemini, is anyone talking about tensor chips in their pixel phone? - nope. Then why Apple, because everyone scrutinizes apple and when there is a small flaw, it'll explode like anything. Now, the writing tools feature is pretty good,  I use it on my Mac, sure its not too advanced but it helps, its not a necessity, moreover Apple is working on it to provide a better one next year, so there's that too and meanwhile I can use GPT. They have a dedicated App for GPT on Mac unlike any other LLM. 

Whatever it be, I think apple has delivered but not like what it used to, we had gotten used to its groundbreaking tech, but this time it was mediocre, which is also good, but not best. So I think we should not just get our hands dirty by involving in reckless Apple AI shaming without a proper analysis.",

"Yes, the false advertisement craps are bad and stupid. But people seem to forget one key point: Apple aims to (or at least claims to) release AI features that run locally.

You get the same old metal as last year with no new features, oh, just like an iPhone...","My phone is over a year old, and basically, all translation features as well as the photo object eraser run locally while offline with wifi and BT disabled in airplane mode.

The reason why is those other products were pioneered by a true visionary in Steve Jobs. Tim Cook isn't that type of CEO that has that vision that Steve Jobs had. Not only that but Apple being a privacy oriented company makes it harder to develop a good AI model as that requires a lot of data to train and they're too stuck up to train an off the shelf model that may produce much better results than doing it from scratch.,
