qlZM3McwO1Q,"This channel is racist! Report the channel, it edited the video to favor the white and not show the Kenyans receiving the medal 🥇"

qlZM3McwO1Q,Algorithm finally did something right
qlZM3McwO1Q,They even rounded the last athlete
qlZM3McwO1Q,It's shows how weak and how lousy U.S.A. and Australian athletes...Kenyans are black diamonds pearl very good disciplines athletes..well done KENYANS.
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Very shameful of world athletics committee to be controlled by Whites from announcers to the stage controllers highlighting the pace of the Australians over the winning champions who were demonstrably in a league of their own in obliteraterating the records in the event.  Faith Kipyegoni,Obiri and Chirono, despite challenge by the Ethiopian women in middle distance running, continue to dominate the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Diamond League over the same distance to date. Very little was showered on this epic journey for the Africans at this event, except for the likes of Steve Ovettts' of the world begrudgingly acknowledging the marvel of central African women's dominace. It's a shame!!"
qlZM3McwO1Q,Those Kenyan girls made that run look effortless. Absolute poetry in motion. Unbelievable. Congratulations from Canada.

qlZM3McwO1Q,That was exciting to watch and the Kenyan girls wow!....that was incredible!
qlZM3McwO1Q,The American trainers told their runners to run like robots: staying upright with rigid formulaic arm movement instead of leaning into the stride and letting arms swing as should naturally happen.  They spend more energy springing upward than forward.
qlZM3McwO1Q,Фантастика
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Super congratulations but who made the video looks like they are haters why they didn't show them getting their praises and they props it just goes to show you these people mentality towards the Black race, Big up my peoples."

qlZM3McwO1Q,"If I'm reading correctly, the Kenyans went 13:40.40 for the 5000m, a full thirty seconds under the women's individual world record at the time (Tirunesh Dibaba at 14:11.15 in 2008), and about 18 seconds under the newly set WR (Beatrice Chebet at 13:58.06 on July 5, 2025).  The Americans, in second place, were under what the individual WR was at the time, but I don't believe they were under Chebet's time.  Amazing progression."

qlZM3McwO1Q,"I can't help but notice childish racists and nationalists are showing up in full force, celebrating their particular race and nationality  instead of individual achievement.  Here's a hint.  If a person from a particular country and of a particular race wins a track meet, honor should go to the athlete who put in the work, not the race or nation from which she or he originates.   Grow up y'all."

qlZM3McwO1Q,Put on some clothes! EAT SOMETHING!!
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Another clickbait misleading headline. This isn't the fastest relay ever (as of this video posting), it was the fastest at the time it was run eleven years ago. Also, the 90+ Legends announcer at 18:37 incorrectly identified the race as a 4 X 1600 meters. It's actually 4 X 1500 meters."

I prefer running on grass.
As it does not hurt your feet.
Also you get all the dust blown in your face.
Not good if your running with your mouth open.
I used to run at school through the woods for 20 minutes
And  aslo Saturday used to run from my mother house.
up to the park and down the road.And sprint finish.
As well as competing with other schools after school.
I still run to the bus stop in the morning and from the other bus stop to work.
Also have running shoes.
You go faster."

qlZM3McwO1Q,"yeah, the ending of this vid was really weird!!!  Like there was no real podium and wha?  It was just strange."
qlZM3McwO1Q,Despite 45 I still wished USA could take the silver medal. It’s good that news media refused to show when Australia overtaking USA. Very painful indeed. Kenya breaking the World Record and not even showing the athletes on the podium receiving their medals was just a low blow beneath the belt. That’s more shameful than just pure racism for the western news media coverage. Not surprising but shameful!

qlZM3McwO1Q,It's amazing you didn't show the winning team damn you dirty
qlZM3McwO1Q,"What is this fetish with saying ""two times"" instead of ""twice""??  IE, ""2 time junior"" cross country champion 6:20; which is not as mellow to the ear, as the simple ""twice Junior"" cross country champion!  A bit like the old fashioned way of  how we used to ""contact"" someone, until the americans felt the need ""to reach out""?  You do that when someone is about to fall?  Is this needless extension of the old fashioned english that necessary?"
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Agreed.  I still use the word ""thrice""... just to wobble folks and make them think.  
The other one that has fallen is how we used to be taught to say ""(so and so) and I"",  which was a selfless way of talking, now, we say ""me and (so and so)""  which is the selfish way of talking.....
English and all its stupidnesses."

qlZM3McwO1Q,Moving out baby
qlZM3McwO1Q,Fastest Relay Ever? Watch This Epic Race and witness pure speed and teamwork like never before!
qlZM3McwO1Q,"On one hand yes this is impressive. On the other hand it was also predictable who was going to win this race. I am someone who does not keep up to date in the world of relay races, but I have watched a fair amount of men’s and women’s relay races. It is no longer a mystery of who will win these races. The reality is that people from Africa, Kenya, and Jamaica have the natural physical attributes built into their DNA to be the fastest runners. 

Anyone from any other nationality is at a severe disadvantage. It lessens the accomplishment of anyone winning at anything if they have all the advantages to give them the win. Especially if those advantages are something they are born with."
qlZM3McwO1Q,All we know is that United Africa beat the other 3 aliens… end of discussion

qlZM3McwO1Q,"@@evelynewanja7503 if you say so... Report: women's 4x1500m – Bahamas 2014

""Kenya’s women’s 4x1500m quartet improved the world record* by more than half a minute to 16:33.58 at the IAAF World Relays in Nassau, The Bahamas, on Saturday (25).

The team of Mercy Cherono, Faith Kipyegon, Irene Jelagat and Hellen Obiri not only took the first prize of US$50,000 but also a world record bonus of US$50,00.

Cherono opened with a leg of 4:07.4, leading at the handover, Kipyegon followed with 4:08.5, Jalegat ran a leg of 4:10.8 with Obiri bringing Kenya home with 4:06.9 (all splits unofficial).

The previous world best of 17:05.72 was set by another Kenyan team in Nairobi last month.

Cherono, the Moscow 2013 5000m silver medallist,  made no effort to start the 4x1500m as aggressively as the Kenyan men had gone after the 4x800m record earlier in the day, and Australia’s Zoe Buckman was able to stay close during the first leg. 

Just after Buckman handed off to Bridey Delaney, however, the USA’s Kate Mackey took the baton from Heather Kampf and ran straight into the Australian lead off runner, with both tumbling to the track. 

Mackey scrambled back to her feet but then faced a gap up to the pair in front of her.

Faith Kipyegon disposed of the Australian threat quite thoroughly in the second leg, opening up an 80-metre gap on Delaney, making her move from 500 metres onwards, before handing off to Jelegat. 

In the third leg, in which Jelegat was running on her own, Kate Grace was able to close the remaining gap between the USA and Australia's Brittany McGowan and overtook the Antipodean to put the USA into second place.

Jelegat slowed a little over the last 400m of her stint, but when she handed off to Hellen Obiri, the record was clearly going to be decimated baring disaster but the latter took off like she was only running 800m, clearing the first lap in just 60 seconds. 

Obiri also benefited from the appearance of the Romanian anchor in front of her, a target to chase, and she lapped the Romanian on her final circuit before leading home the first team to run under 17 minutes for the event.

The US women also came in under the old best at 16:55.33, and Australia's 17:08.65 for third was in shouting distance and an Area record. 

Romania, lapped and trailing in fourth, still set another national record with their 17:51.48.""

qlZM3McwO1Q,🎉🎉🎉 congratulations my people always win 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Unbelievable stuff, heck of a race, congratulations to Kenya. One problem, they showed the USA comfortable over Australia and them crossing the finish line in second, then said Australia got the silver and USA got the Bronze. ????"
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Nah, USA got silver, 13 seconds ahead of the Aussies.  What was shown kinda confirms that, as the Aussie's came out first, for the presentaion, which would make sense if they finished third.  Despite the US being 22 seconds behind Kenya, they were still under the previous world record time, which shows what an amazing run the Kenyan's performed that day."
qlZM3McwO1Q,Wow!
qlZM3McwO1Q,I hope there werent any men running in that relay. A lot of sickos mutilate their genitalia just so they can cheat and compete in women's sports.
qlZM3McwO1Q,"Typical US athletes, big egos with litlle to show for it. Their president is prime example. Even the Australian over took them."

Aside from being long and boring, this race dates back to 2014!"

qlZM3McwO1Q,It was not a serious event. And of course not an official event of IAAFJust for fun and show.Relays with ONLY 4 competitors teams? TO be serious has to be announced long time ago and to participate minimum 16 national teams with semifinals and etc.
qlZM3McwO1Q,The music nearly ruined watching this record race.

qlZM3McwO1Q,"I don't cast any dispersion over the greatness of this event.  Such accomplished runners!  What an achievement!!
  BUT
_This race_ was run in 2014, 11 years ago.  

The next team to break the record was in 2020 with a time of 16: 27. 02 , a women's track club from Portland.

""90+Legends"" channel is *_repackaging old stuff._*   They show track and field history since 1999, hence ""Legends.""  However, they don't make that very clear. 
Apparently ""90+Legends"" saw an opportunity.

To be fair, this 2014 event was introduced in the past tense.  But the way it was set up made it seem like it was within the last few days, not _more than a decade._

The channel should have announced it as a 2014 event , with a bumper meme, right _at the beginning._"
qlZM3McwO1Q,🎉I love Kenya 🇰🇪

qlZM3McwO1Q,"""fearless""??  What in-the-world does fear have to do with running in a sports event (I've been there as a competitor, so don't trifle with me)??   Fear of losing?  Any competitor that is experiencing fear is in need of psychiatric assistance.   At this level of competition fear is the last thing that encumbers a competent athlete.  *Good video, but the WOKE hype is getting old.*"

Australia in third barely missed the existing world record, 17:08.65,  USA was almost 13 seconds faster that the record when they stepped on the track.  16:55.33  Of Course Kenya was almost 35 seconds better at 16:33.58"

#NAME?,"Good morning team LNN,
Thank you for tuning in!
What are your thoughts on today's conversation?

You can always contact us via our emails: Info@Lnn.digital or Lynn.ngugi@Lnn.digital"
#NAME?,"The same way we ignored ruto's red flags, is the same way matiang'i's red flags will be ignored😢😢
Sitachoka kuwaambia kura zetu ndio zikona nguvu, sisi ndio tutaamua strong candidate ni nani.
Maraga/Omtatah is The HOPE for CHANGE we need 🇰🇪✊🏿💯"
#NAME?,​@@shuleezshoes1789I agree Matiang'i personality is no difference from Ruto. But he'll be pushed as a front runner by cartels...politics in this country inachosha sana. Genzs need yo provide alternative leadership and market that candidate aggressively
#NAME?,"Lynn please search for that lady who was conned by Ahmednasir , give her a platform  please."
#NAME?,"The ge z should slow down 
And stop demonstrating for the rest of the term
They helped indirectly azimio,,to get into broad government 
They need to mobilize all young people for voting in 2027
Allow ruto to finish his term
Because demonstrations do harm the economy 
Ruto is preferred president by east african,,and all countries except drc,burundi!!
Would support him to get his 2nd"
#NAME?,"They ignored uhuru!!
Who knew the best candidate 
Now his people are paying ​@@shuleezshoes1789"
#NAME?,Our voice matter to🎉❤🇮🇱🇰🇪

#NAME?,Thank you LNN for bringing people who know what to say unlike the Citizen TV they just bring people they don’t know what to say lather than 1 term
#NAME?,"Kenya Gen-Z Revelution 2025 is the new Kenya Government leaders in 2027.  Among Them is to be president and Deputy President 
Their interview was fantastic and
Good luck in the Government Office"
#NAME?,Gen-Z Ochieng is 🍨 be the President in 2027. God is with you’
#NAME?,"All of the the Gen-Z interview are very special and they are intelligent, humble and are forcus. All of you youngsters go a head with your advocate.  God be with you all"
#NAME?,Bravo Mulamba. Keep the spirit up of Gen-Z. You are a leader
#NAME?,Sofie shoul be Kenya President in 2027
#NAME?,"Good morning lynn Ngugi, I've been searching for a lady who said she writes cv on your videos and I haven't get that video yet kindly help me with her number"
#NAME?,"It's a kiburi money making system.. It's all about Money n laws,  useless positions, salary, institutions. We've given too much power to leaders, even dictate their ballooned salaries ! How now?? The voice of us the people, is of God."
#NAME?,"For me,as a GEN-Z,I know that whenever the young people come out to protest,we are always very peaceful and don't like destroying other people's property,Instead there are some goons who are always taking advantage of this,and they have sponsored by the state. We cannot allow this to continue anymore, because the country is slowly sliding to a state of anarchy; which is not a very good thing."
#NAME?,Go To  Makerere University In Uganda
#NAME?,Imagine these are the grate minds they are trying to suppress and extinguish prematurely instead of tapping into it and steer the country (the African continent) to grateness.
#NAME?,How do you say this one is tribalist when the other side is explicitly saying mountain like he’s entitled?
#NAME?,GEN ' Z  2075
#NAME?,2050
#NAME?,THE MASAI MARA
#NAME?,MAU MAU  !!!
#NAME?,I salute the Gen-Z pannel. Admirerably articulate in identifying the maladies afflicting Kenya. Their discussion is superb unlike the wasteful dramas we get from the transactional parliament.
#NAME?,Kenya  has become a police state. TheGenZ movement is not  alone. The Youth of Africa and the world stands with the revolutionary  GenZ movement against the  represive governmen̈t of Willian Ruto and his corrupt puppets.
#NAME?,Kenya's leadership knows what Kenya needs. But they are compromised by white monopoly capital and the superpowers. And not just the current government but all governments since 1963.
#NAME?,"Lynn,y r u not airing gachagua in Seattle?"
#NAME?,Brilliant minds on set.
#NAME?,"This guy James mulamba 🔥 he will b a good leader 
Kudos to these young adults for being brave .
May God hide them"
#NAME?,"I visited a family friend who’d been detained over a minor issue. We expected a routine process to secure his release, but I was stunned by what I saw. The police station was in a dire state, where offices were crumbling, broken furniture everywhere, and vital witness documents scattered across the floors. The officers’ living quarters were even worse, barely habitable. These are the very people tasked with upholding order and protecting citizens, yet they themselves are working in conditions that reflect deep neglect. How can we expect fairness, accountability, and effective policing when those in uniform are barely supported by the systems they serve?"
#NAME?,"These are our future leaders, articulate, passionate, and committed to genuine change for Kenyans. Why is this such an affront to the government?"
#NAME?,"Lynn, please create short videos for tiktok, Instagram, and youtube from this discussion to amplify the agenda of the GenZ movement 🙏"
#NAME?,"The British, Indians, and Arabs use tribal divisions to rule Kenyans and Tanzanians. The British, Arabs, and Indians control  the economy in Kenya and Tanzania. They manipulate the tribal, economic, and political climate using willing corrupt black tribal leaders of Kenya and Tanzania."
#NAME?,"Never give up...my Father was a Maumau war veteran,fought and was detained for long  and survived . Freedom is Never free.."
#NAME?,"No liberation movement ever came easy. That has to sink into the liberators hearts and minds.

And those that have offered themselves to further the struggle should not be discouraged. The spirit of liberation must burn brilliantly to the end of the anticipated results. 

GEN Z have awakened the dormant spirit of our forefathers. The desire for a  united country and with equal rights for everyone. With a working constitution that is upheld by all without sacred cows.

GEZ N you’re the last guardrails for a better Kenya. Do not give up, don’t be distracted, don’t be intimidated, keep the fight on. 

Keep the fight on, Kenya needs good governance and cannot be trusted to the same political players. 

Viva GEN Z , Viva Kenya!!!"

#NAME?,I did not hear anything about abduction corrupt politician or tuition fees when the AES movement was going on. You need to have a movement that supersede these urban woes. Ruto can sell the country and sack 2 corrupt politicians out of 100 at the end of his term while you will celebrate and call it progress and probably give him another term. You guys are fighting tiny little endless urban woes and strife. Point the finger at your real handlers from the comfort of their Western world. Go to their embassies. Bases.  And tell them to get out.
#NAME?,Women Reps should not be included in the Kenyan Government at all in future Elections with effect from the next elections. They earn money and they don't have responsibilites. They have never been in the Government in the previous Years
#NAME?,"You keep calling it a civil disobedience, when people are fed up with government disobedience, how about saying it's a civil uprising.  People are fed up with the waste and misappropriation of their tax dollars. Raising grocery prices with higher taxes that people already not able to afford.  I feel bad that African leaders are so dismissive of people's issues."
#NAME?,"She nailed her last remarks.  All of them articulated themselves exceptionally well.  I pray 🙏 for their success.  I’m encouraged to witness Africans not being passive to these nonsensical ways our countries are being governed.  I recently learned Nigerian president gave the lead position of ECOWAS to one of the dumbest presidents in Africa.  He even had the audacity to demand President Traore step down as head of state.  This demand coming from a president whose daughter is dating a drug dealer and hiding him in their country to avoid serving justice in his country.  This is how confident these fake leaders have become. They are used to the masses being non complaisant, fearful, disempowered and passive to their ways."
#NAME?,Alam you have it very right
#NAME?,"James, you have it all right.Tell them straight in the face."
#NAME?,"This is very encouraging.Genzs,I egg you on.Kudos it's a move in the right direction."
#NAME?,I guess she wants to be the leader! Being leaderless is why we cannot be bought
#NAME?,"The Gen Z revolution figures (those present in this meeting) should be the ones ruling Kenya today! These guys have far much better vision and ideas to take Kenya forward compared to the scare crow William Ruto who is so scared and fearful of losing his position to a point he is creating and spinning whoop (shit) that the government is about to be overthrown by imaginary forces because he is afraid of the repercussion he will face for killing the Gen Z, besides other colossal crimes he has committed to the Kenyan people. Ruto is trying to scare the Kenyan people to buy more time to kill and steal. I do agree the Gen Z needs to have a committed representative to provide leadership guidance and direction in the way war against Ruto must be executed, fought, and carried out to have a more structured operation within the Gen Z movement. There is no military force in the world that goes to war without a commanding officer in charge, and a command structure organized to win the battle. Ruto requires a battle hardened Gen Z to get rid of him. Finally, those betraying the Gen Z movement eg Kasmuel, Morara, etc must call out to order! Gen Z can’t have moles and commercial benefactors within the ranks if it has to succeed in removing Ruto from the statehouse! Ruto must go soonest to save Kenya and to bring peace to the chaotic and anarchical state of quagmire that Ruto has created to confuse the minds of the Kenyan people so he can buy more time to do more demonic satanic evil to our beloved country!"
#NAME?,"God is the leader of us ,don't fear He is with us,He has a good plan for you all."
#NAME?,Guys but Junet is the most stupid tribal Kenyan alive! This guy only deserves to lead Somalia Alshabab and pirates in the Indian Ocean only!
#NAME?,"Africa prays for your success in your endeavors for Kenyan.  As an African, I sincerely feel your frustration! Watching these fake leaders repeatedly rob our nations with no consequences, and young people losing their lives, simply because they demand growth, is indeed hurtful 😩😩😩😩😩😩"
#NAME?,"God has raised up an army, these young pple are the maumau reincarnate. God is with them."
#NAME?,Very good conversation amongst our young people. Kenya has a bright future with the young people in leadership positions.
#NAME?,"Stay fighting until you get the freedom you deserve. You’re the now and the future, there’s no freedom without a fights. Stay safe and God bless you all. You’ll win. Yes 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿"
#NAME?,Our president should be in a lunatic asylum. He has completely lost his mind.
#NAME?,"Our dear GenZ, rest assured that we are with you as your mothers. Not just now, but some of us have always been with you. Count on us mothers. Congratulations for your solid resolve, your intelligence, dignity, and unity. Keep it up!"
#NAME?,"why western colonial names force on this kids?
  Ruto is winning because the momentum was lost when you guys take over the parliament and also lost the state house, Kenyans should learn from what Sri Lanka and Bangladesh did when the Conner their corrupt leader."
#NAME?,"... they dont like Ruto, but the money theyre being given.. Greed. Well said."
#NAME?,Proudly kenyan and elated to see our children know what they want and will stand for it no matter what
#NAME?,"I love this guy james very sharp-witted, eti ""ameliorate"" ""idiosyncrasies"" & obstinate"" ""benevolent"""
#NAME?,"I like the sentiments of adding a clause in the constitution to impeach the president direct by the people, let's get it going and fight for the addition of this clause. Can we vote on this and push for referendum. This will make all elected positions competitive and accountable."
#NAME?,"wow, am so impressed by these young GenZs who have demonstrated in this video that they have leadership capacity to truly bring change in Kenya. And the young lady in this discussion is exceptionally wonderful, great, brilliant and highly intelligent. These are the young minds with capacity to lead. I particularly admire their determination that Kenya must be changed for the better. Much respect to these youth who are sacrificing alot to raise the consciousness of Kenyans to understand that the People are Sovereign and can bring the change that the country desires. Kudos too to Lynn Ngugi for her great videos, quite insightful, thought provoking for a better Kenya. Keep up the good work Lynn, you are just great"
#NAME?,The moment you pick a leader he will be bought by the Politicians and that will be the end.
#NAME?,We are right behind you  our Champs.  You are indeed the change that Kenya needs. May the Lord protect you 🙏
#NAME?,What a powerful discussion. These young Kenyans ooze so much wisdom. We are rallying behind and will support you 👊🏾
#NAME?,"Brilliant minds, please organise yourselves and vie for most of the positions."
#NAME?,"Hi  good people.., I really need your help.
I’m doing everything I can to change my life. I want to go to Saudi Arabia and finally build something better for myself. I already have some money and managed to raise what I could for the passport, but I’m short of just 5K
I’ve tried asking around, I’ve struggled and sacrificed—this is my last push.
Please, if you can help me complete this, I’ll be forever grateful 😢
...even if its lending me 😢.ill refund kindly 😢😢😢"
#NAME?,"You want to go to Saudia Arabia? Why there friend?

This is not a country for an Afrikan with no money.  

Better you listen to this video again and join the conversation and the fight."
#NAME?,"I only pray God that Something will Happen soonest possible.
These young people deserve better leadership"
#NAME?,The kenyans need to fight for things like resource naturalization. Leaving the commonwealth and acquiring Russian miliary space and science assistance. All of this missing person protest is comfort that the ruto administration can handle. Wave the Russian flag. They can stop abduction tomorrow  but it still wont mean Kenyans will have a gold reserve or Kenyans will be building factories own by them at home and abroad. It will not mean protection and sovereignty of Kenyan market. It will not mean Kenya will compete with the west in any form. Build aircraft and naval craft. The things they fight about are things that the ruto administration can sit forever and talk to them about it while. The real issues like i listed above stay out of the convo and the lexicon. In short. They need harder dreams.
#NAME?,Did I understand you to say they should  wave the Russian flag or was that sarcasm? 🤔
#NAME?,​@stadarkua3830  Did they not do it in the AES? What makes Kenya so special that they cant do it? Stop being inspired by other movements if you dont have the guts and will to do what they did.
#NAME?,​@@stadarkua3830 Did they not do it in the AES? What makes Kenya so special that they cant do it? Stop being inspired by other movements if you dont have the will to do what they did.

#NAME?,How is the regime crumbling yet we are all waiting for 2027 elections? RUTO IS TUTAM.
#NAME?,We are behind you...Get organised you have our support
#NAME?,"I love the spirit in gen z's, very informed and fearless when addressing issues that need change , you are Gods sent and He will continue protecting you"
#NAME?,"I shouldn't even be writing this because it goes against everything we're taught about &quot;being a good person,&quot; but I can't stay silent anymore. Four months ago, I was trapped in that beta mindset where I thought hard work and integrity would eventually pay off, while watching ruthless people take everything I'd earned. Then I discovered 22 Dark Truths of Winning, and it was like finding the cheat codes that powerful people use but never admit. The author can't reveal his identity because these courtroom and boardroom secrets would destroy his legal career, but he was tired of watching good men get eaten alive. The psychological tactics inside are so precise, so devastatingly effective, they feel almost illegal. I've stopped trying to win arguments and started controlling outcomes. Stopped chasing respect and started commanding it. This book will make you uncomfortable - it should. Because once you see how the real game is played, you can never go back to being the nice guy who finishes last. Every man who's done being walked on needs this wake-up call."
#NAME?,this book was lifechanging for me
#NAME?,thank you
#NAME?,"one of the best books ive ever read, glad someone is talking about it"
#NAME?,"just got it on their website, thank you"
#NAME?,in my opinion this comment should be pinned to the top
#NAME?,"I'm in complete disbelief right now. Just eight weeks ago, I was that frustrated guy watching less qualified people climb past me because they knew how to &quot;play the game&quot; while I sat there being honest and hoping fairness would save me. Then I found this controversial book called 22 Dark Truths of Winning, and reading it felt like discovering state secrets. The author had to stay anonymous because exposing these high-level manipulation tactics from his law career would end everything for him. The truths inside are so dark, so effective, they made me question everything I thought I knew about success. I stopped being the guy who explains and started being the guy who just moves. Stopped seeking approval and started creating dependency. My whole dynamic at work shifted - people who used to dismiss me now hang on my every word. This book is dangerous to read if you still believe the world rewards good behavior. But if you're ready to stop losing quietly, it's everything you need."
#NAME?,"﻿I'm literally shaking as I type this because I finally understand why I've been losing my whole life. Six months ago, I was that guy getting passed over for promotions, watching dumber people get ahead while I followed every rule like a good little soldier. Then I found this dark book called 22 Dark Truths of Winning by an anonymous author, and the content felt illegal to read. He can't even put his name on it because the truths inside would destroy his career. I read it in one sitting at 2 AM, and something inside me snapped. I stopped explaining myself, stopped playing fair, started using the psychological tactics he teaches. Within weeks, people started treating me differently. My boss actually apologized to me yesterday. This isn't about being evil - it's about finally understanding the game everyone else is playing while you're sitting on the bench. Every man who's tired of losing needs to read this at least once."
#NAME?,"My hands won't stop shaking because I finally found the playbook they've been hiding from us. Two months ago, I was drowning in that nice guy hell where hard work meant nothing and politics ruled everything. Then I discovered 22 Dark Truths of Winning, and the content felt like psychological warfare wrapped in brutal honesty. The author is anonymous because revealing these corporate law secrets would destroy him, but he couldn't watch good men get crushed anymore. Truth #13 ended a toxic friendship and tripled my leverage at work. Truth #22 made me untouchable. I don't argue anymore - I just position. I don't beg for respect - I engineer it. This isn't about becoming a sociopath. It's about understanding that while you're playing checkers, everyone else is playing chess. If you're sick of being the nice guy who gets nothing, this book will wake you up in ways you're not prepared for."
#NAME?,"I probably shouldn't be saying this publicly, but I don't recognize the man I was three months ago. I used to be that nice guy who always finished last, wondering why liars and manipulators kept getting everything I deserved. Then I stumbled across 22 Dark Truths of Winning, and it felt like finding a forbidden manual that powerful people don't want you to see. The author literally can't reveal his identity because these secrets would end his law career. Truth #7 alone changed how I handle every conversation - I stopped caring about being liked and started focusing on being respected. The shift has been terrifying. My income doubled, my relationships improved, and people who used to ignore me now seek my approval. This book doesn't teach you to be a good person. It teaches you to win in a world that eats good people alive. Read it before someone uses these tactics on you."
#NAME?,"A leader for GenZ is important: a spokesperson, a servant of the people, a political representative. 
The power distribution in the new political setting should consider the positive goals of a developing gem called Kenya. 
Yes doubts sets in to act against one another in the establishment of this new setting. We could revise and change the system of governance and accountability that protects our people and our values. For this we need stable circles, like cells that form a baby. Circles of different organs. We need development strategists( agriculture, commerce, mines,infrastructure...), we need political strategists( I see potential in this GenZ panel😊), we need doctors and medicine men/women, we need the couragious spirit, we need negotiators and peace keepers ( for eventual peace in turbulent times) we need all the love and support.
Thank you my fellow brothers and sisters.
🎉"
#NAME?,"Of course thank you Lynn and your incredible Team for this platform of learning, unlearning and relearning."
#NAME?,"Kudos Gen Z articulating issues very well.The whole system is rotten.Solution is what Field Marshall James mukamba is saying,Set an example by Recalling these MPs"
#NAME?,A great roundtable! Optimism is not an option. I am very hopeful for Kenya.

#NAME?,"We must agree that Kenya has two tribes only, the annihilator and annihilated"

#NAME?,Kenyans should know outward beauty is vanity if brain exhibits naivety.
#NAME?,"This is great talk… 
Thanks to Lynn Ngugi

#NAME?,May Almighty God protect you all
#NAME?,"Mr. Ruto and to every single Kenyan politician who thinks that stealing money from the tax payers and manipulating the public to vote for them and make rules that favor them and force the system to keep them in office/ power for eternity should wake up and smell the coffee.

I have a lot of hope for Kenya. I’m actually excited. The young people are speaking. They have brains and knowledge to run the affairs of this nation. They have power to contribute and shape the future of our nation. The country may look as if it’s in crisis at the moment but it is in very good hands. 
Ruto and your home boys you are loosing at an alarming rate and the young people are gaining at an unprecedented pace. 
Ruto and all the corrupt politicians who have failed our nation; You will have nowhere to hide very soon."
#NAME?,Leta Waigera the car guy.
#NAME?,"This team......wow!  Our very smart  Gen Zs. Lynn, please keep bringing such  discussions. It is educative to those who are against these very intelligent youths. It is our Mps who have failed us big time. I am very proud of these  Gen Zs, very proud mum of these  youths."
#NAME?,Let Ruto try and mess with the election process or results in 2027. These young people are not joking.
#NAME?,"Brilliant, well-informed, and tribeless. I'm so proud to be part of Gen Z. The revolution has already started, and we cannot look back. Having a platform to express our concerns is crucial for driving change in this nation.  These guys are representing us well."
#NAME?,Maybe Kenya can do what  Ghana did . Just calmly endure the current government without any riots and vote them out during the next elections for a better government.
#NAME?,"Endurance with faith can move mountains when guided by truth, even silence becomes a powerful stand.
What helps a nation stay calm and hopeful while waiting for change?"
#NAME?,Awesome and bright youth's do not loose your  sight keep it on behind you 💯
#NAME?,"This comment is geared 2. The thugs that have been hired. The police department and the thugs are organized, but the Kenyan people who are out protestin. G they're not organized. That's one of the problems now, if people are able.  To get pictures of the faces of these thugs and then pass the pictures around through the network and find out where these people live individually, they're not tough and then want to find out where they live.  You have to handle business just like they handle business.
There has to be organization instead of just coming out protesting."
#NAME?,"I’m so proud of all of you revolutionaries on the panel!, indeed we shall overcome!, Amen and Amen! 🙏🏿"
#NAME?,"Five African presidents humiliated by Trump in the white house.Don't we ever learn,what is sooo special about Trump?????? 😢😢😢😢😢😢"

#NAME?,"Don't be ""dead inside"" son. We need you whole and strong.💪🏾"
#NAME?,"Kaongo's strategy is to impoverish Kenyans, that way, it's easy to subdue any protests!"
#NAME?,It would be nice if next time Have faith in our primary language alongside English. I felt like some of these strong speakers would have made an even bigger impact had they relayed their messages in the language they practice everyday and are extremely comfortable speaking in. Having to translate thoughts to English sometimes waters down what and how the audience is supposed to feel. Mix English na Kiswahili and whatever else.
#NAME?,"Watching from st.lucia, brave young people, you should be proud of yourselves for you braveness, sad that some young persons had to loose their lives.  the blood of the dead is on rutos hand he can never have a happy life."

Kenya in deed have a lot of Traores that can make the country great. This have given me hope. I wish they can have a chama that can be voted for come next election."
#NAME?,"Could it be coincidence that every country in Africa is led by a incompetent, corrupt useless president, even after 60, 70 years of independence?. What does that tell about the people that elect leaders in Africa?"

#NAME?,SOLIDARITY!!!!!!!
#NAME?,"The voice of people is NOT the voicevof Hod.
It IS the bojcevof the peopke!"
#NAME?,"Firstly, if you do not have a plan and a goal, you are planning to fail.               A team/ mob needs a plan and a leader to guide them. A leader Must have the skills to delegate duties. Kenyan presidents expect that maybe Kibaki lacks delegating skills. You can not govern the whole of Kenya on your own.  Meaning there must be a HIERARCHY for you, Gen Z, to succeed. Make small groups, as this will be easier to manage. For example, if we have Owjogo (Kisumu) being the leader of that region. Owjogo- must be able to have at least 10 sub-leaders to support him. These team leaders should lead that small area. The team leader can also appoint a few helpers; they all must report to him/her, and share the outcome with Owjogo. Then, Owjogo will call a meeting to discuss what went well and what improvement is needed to do better next time. Sophie(the lady in this video) states here that there are no Leaders to give directions.  So, select a leader. A calm person and a good listener.  Always use a list of what you will do. Firstly, list all Nairobi estates, and each should have a leader. Examples, Kibera, Mathare, 44, 45, etc.  For you to win, you must work closely with the police. The police and the Army can not be enemies. Do not attack them even if they attack one of your own. If you attack a police officer, that is it. You lose the battle. As two wrongs can not make it right. Next time, carry 2 Bottles of water and handle one to a police officer/ Army ask them how they are doing. Thank them even if you think they are rubbish at what they are doing. This approach creates a step closer to achieving your goal. Be canning. Fake it until you make it. You can not allow anyone to carry a stone, a Panga, or any object. This must be a policy and must be followed by all demonstrators. Any looter, hand them over to the police and the army. Use your mobile phone to record. With mobile phones these days, even police matatu bribery should end. Record and share it on social media. Go to the police and share this.  If the police attack anyone do not attack them back. Hand them a bottle of water. This makes them relate to you and come to your side. The leaders should go to the police headquarters and speak to the person in charge regarding a police officer assaulting a civilian. If you have a video and a picture of the police officer, they are more likely to be fired. This example will be a learning tool for the others. Do not give up even if they are not fired. Do it over and over again.   You must be a friend to all, even those who support Ruto or the person you see as an enemy. Try and win them to come to your side.  Now my question for you, Gen Z? You want Ruto to go, do you have anyone that you think is better than Ruto? Who is not corrupt? What do you think of Martha Karua?  Do you have competent well well-schooled lawyers in your age group that can change the Kenyan corrupt courts?    Do you have a number of you who have negotiation skills?   Smart people who can amend the Constitution that meet Kenyans' needs?  Go to YouTube and learn how to be a good leader. What kind of leadership is suitable in Kenya? Democratic, transformation, dictatorship, etc.   You are very lucky you were born when the world was one. Internet, free information online. You are supposed to be the cleverest generation. You can learn too much from YouTube.  Seek support for the Kenyan living abroad too, and ask them to go to Number 10 in the UK or to the Kenyan embassy in the country they are in, to share your voices.  Request a meeting with President Ruto. You will be surprised that he will sit down with you and tell you his challenges. Do not go there to bring him down; try to ask him to make things better. Go there to win him to be a better leader for you all.  I am not into politics, but an entrepreneur and felt a need to share my thoughts.  My motto is ""If there is anything you can ever be, be kind.""  Ensure the city is left spotless. No littering. Clean the street after demonstrations. This will make the age group over 40 years of age support you to vote for the leader of your choice. Wishing you all the best."
#NAME?,"And could we start saying Gen Zote instead of Gen Z?

#NAME?,"Ruto is dealing with a smart crowd 
No wonder he is so crude"
#NAME?,""" The citizens has a supreme power ""  period ❤❤"
#NAME?,I am beginning to believe that LNN should start a series to educate Kenyans on the salient issues of governance and what bars we should be raising when electing leadership (we need to stop taking it as a joke by checking on beauty and all these nonsense).  We will need lawyers who can break down the job roles in a language we will understand so we know what to expect from leaders .  It will prepare the electorate for the task in 2027 and in the future.  It should never be about the person who talks the loudest; the one with loads of money; the one with good looks or comes from an influential family. These nonsense needs to be put to rest
#NAME?,Brilliant guys. It's time we need fresh and young blood in the political and governance system. These old guys should give way to the younger generation.
#NAME?,These useless women reps should be sent home today so that this government knows we are serious.   We can't have careless women coming to laugh at the cause (with all the deaths witnessed) to massage egos at the top.  It is totally unacceptable.
#NAME?,If you are a wise Kikuyu Genz you will stay away from protests.
#NAME?,"So good to listen to you all!!!! Your points are all correct and I really think much thought must be given to the idea that ""leaderlessness"" is no longer practical and effective. Hoping to see some of you running for political  leadership in the future - especially the woman in the group."
#NAME?,Tribeless sounds nice 🤝 WANTAM
#NAME?,Haftam
#NAME?,"Why aren't  you young, intelligent, educated people stand up and lead you country. Why not run for office and step to the forefront. These are  the leaders that they need in Africa. Ibrahim Traore has empowered the gen-z to step up. It's time to organize and find solutions to your problems. Stop looking for outsiders or these puppets to fix the country. Some of problems are that older politicians have been shaking hands with the devil to get things done. Young people you have the gift and energy. Start leading your countries."
#NAME?,"The change is coming    ,viva genz"
#NAME?,"Listen up,  it's not hard for you to do what you seek to achieve. 1:  Arrange for a meeting with your members of Parliament. 2: In that meeting,  sign an agreement with them. The agreement is to support them in their quest for a second term in Parliament.  3: In the agreement, state clearly and categorically what you want them to help you achieve in Parliament. Whether it's impeachment of your governor or any other person, the magic is in the details. Just thinking.........."
#NAME?,Kenyan politics is tribal.nyinyi ni watoto hamjielewi
#NAME?,"Smart individuals but let's be real there is a tribal movement hijacking it. I am and have been Lynn Ngugis biggest supporter from Day1, always subbed, always donated but I worry she is low-key being hijacked too. I'm with the genZ movement but when I see examples of our ex president being used it just leaves a bad taste. They are all evil. Uhuru just sat in his seat drunk and took advantage of working Kenyans. He worked closely with the current president and did the exact same things, there just wasn't any scrutiny. He even tampered with the election together with Ruto to force Kenyans into his second term. They are all one and the same, this one, Uhuru, Kibaki, Moi, Jommo....they are all one and the same...that's the cycle that needs challenging not supremism"
#NAME?,"This young people need to have a chama and we kenyans we will fund it,this is all we need great minds 👏👏👏"

#NAME?,"If they get a leader now, he/she will be compromised before election"
#NAME?,"Very true even in the emergency period of 1950's, there were traitors."
#NAME?,Kudo to Genzs kenyan people should aspire for better leaders not about money and been bought voting should be free and fair. Once this politicians get your votes they get busy yo recover their money spent with profits. Clearly we wait new generation but also people  who are responsible and can be accountable and happy to step down if they're not performing.  Thanks.. yes new reform is much needed.
#NAME?,I have just watched the story of Romania - read about Nicolae Ceaușescu and you will be shocked how similar our situations.   The same tactics to cause fear as used by this regime.
#NAME?,Very good debate and analysis on the way the state of the nation is and how some issues need to be solved.
#NAME?,"Instead of using your God given platform to preach hope and positivity, you instead choose to propagate hate. It’s okay. The internet will always remember. 

You will bear responsibility (both legal and moral) one day.

#NAME?,Tribes is a reality but Tribalism is very bad.
#NAME?,"Brilliant youth, speaking with such eloquence and thoughtfulness that is lacking in the present leadership."
#NAME?,They are for sure 🙏
#NAME?,The leadership knows what Kenya needs. But they are compromised by white monopoly capital and the superpowers.
#NAME?,"Am loving this generation, i pray that what they have started will stand in years to come🙏🙏"
#NAME?,"The struggle continues, until the end"
#NAME?,He can be impeached. There must be a way. Find a way. Even if it is against human rights.
#NAME?,"Congratulations on a truly outstanding political discussion! Your thoughtful insights, respectful exchanges, and diverse perspectives made for a wise and productive conversation. It’s inspiring to see you - the YOUTH, having such a high level of engagement and open-mindedness. Finally, Kenya is FREE. ~Thank you."
#NAME?,"I guess we need mps who ,stand with solidality in the next goverment"
#NAME?,"Keep it simple, FIND your leader with morale's. Do not allow those without morals, who have no care for the state and only themselves to destabilize the cause. That is what they want. FIND your leader WITH MORALES and Cares for our Country, just know ahead of time there will be sacrifice. I pray for you to succeed."
#NAME?,"What Ochieng  said , is  so true about those leaders liking the money and having no agenda coz they are there only there to benefit themselves"
#NAME?,Not too young lead
#NAME?,Next day when people are killed ruto talks about building church.i hope this government goes before 2027
#NAME?,True they dont like ruto but the money.ruto is so stupid that all those people are their for money and thats why you see how things have turn out. You can tell how ruto dont think and how the government can just talk how they want
#NAME?,"Who/what is 'overthrowing' government?  Lies, lack of leadership, lack of accountability, corruption, extrajudicial killings, abductions, state-sanctioned police brutality, media censorship, incompetence, largess, and contempt for the Constitution."
#NAME?,"This was a very brilliant conversation  and educative forum from the true Genzs.
I'm watching from Atlanta, and I still wonder why Mr. Morara dropped from the movement  when we had put a lot of hope and trust in him. 
Our Prayers are that whatever is the reason that he'll never betray the Genzs he viciously fought for ."
#NAME?,"@Cecilia, Morara dropping out just before June 25th anniversary was strategic and suspect. This was to pass a message. Let’s just focus on making Kenya Great Again. This mediocre Ruto  government MUST GO"
#NAME?,"I am a dedicated fan of Morara since he surfaced in about July 3024.
Of all candidates for any office in Kenya, he really was my hope. His understanding of how the dystens work and don’t work is impressive.
He went in wholeheartedly and ……. was constantly and continuously  met with heckling and accusations if all kinds.
If you have followed any of his platform, the suspicion and demonization was immense.

I am sure he was so discouraged after less than one year, that he simply had to decide what was more important: his education of Kenyans or his health, family and  business..

It is a huge loss for Kenya and especially the youth. And for the Gen Zote.
However, he says that if we think we need him, he will be there.
But Kenyans are not ready for his integrity and his insight."
#NAME?,We have alternative youth leaders why would you persist on heaping your hopes ok one failure?
#NAME?,"@@jameswambua4088
Morara is in a league of his own. 
He is no failure.
Just realistic.
Kenyans are not ready for change.
And I, sadly, agree with him."
#NAME?,"These young people are the leaders of ""right now""!"
#NAME?,The best video of the week🎉.
#NAME?,Thanks 😊
#NAME?,1:08:01 You cannot say Boniface Mwangi is a commercial activist when he vied for a seat in Starehe and people didn't vote for him. He has even been speaking about the people who died and fighting for them. Being part of Civic education. When we fight against each other they win
#NAME?,"He his a commercial activist, I am sorry this truth is uncomfortable"
#NAME?,"Do we need to creat mobs to overthrow an elected government instead of a ballot vote to change the system,just watch somalia and the concequence"

So good at law.

Thank guys. Heaven will grant your wishes. We need such youths in Africa at large. Not to used as polical pones by these MZEEs .

#NAME?,"Gzs should avoid picking a leader to lead them now they should remain as they are right  now let them chose a leader  just before the 2027 election, should be honest  and mature people like omutata , maraga, leaders  who have displayed selflessness.such leaders will guarantee Kenyans that they will not be back to the streets for the same reasons they are now, otherwise any other leaders ,2028 back to the streets."
#NAME?,"kudos lyn,,,how i wish we could have this guys allover the media   and even national television you guys are game changers you are speaking pure sense,,,,,its time we bring some change,,,,,,,,,,,,

its very alarming that when other nation leaders are focusing great things like AI, nuclear energy and space colonization our leaders are just point fingers and doing stupid things,,,,,,,,keep pushing hard fellow genzs don't be divided by these people they are just politicians not leaders and its high time they know we are not not 1860s its 2025 and the world is changing very fast"
#NAME?,This team of young people is brilliant. I hope each one of them will present themselves for leadership. I believe there are more of them in Kenya and we need them to take over as soon as possible!
#NAME?,"The young people in Kenya and around the world should please stop using the term ""tribe."" This term is rooted in violent colonial domination from which they want to be free. The more accurate terms to use (even though some are also problematic) are ""ethnic group,"" ""people,"" ""group"", ""nation"" or ""language group."""
#NAME?,"The gez z movement of kenya is a big concerned to east african countries and the rest of the continent or even world wide!!!

But not now,not in this 1st term nor in ruto 2nd term!!!
What gen z are doing, will probably prevent ruto to change constitution for a 3rd term
Don't blame ruto,,,blame central kenya that was lured by ruto to vote for him!!
We all know baabaa,,,would have been different,,,and who best knows the best candidate other than uhuru!!!
Again,right after election, I had asked a friend,,,who is ruto(he said ruto is a merciless person who will eliminate anyone on his way)"
#NAME?,We the majority citizens are in support of the genuine Gen Zs. We see you and hear you. Am a proud mum of a Gen Z. Kasongo generally in his stupid arrogance and stubbornness is in fear and that’s why he is using the racist narrative to divide and rule.

#NAME?,"Leaderless is the way, because it is a very potent weapon against the political class who are used to buying 'Leaders'. If Gen Z were to have a leader, in 1 year, they will have chosen over 20 people to lead them because the political class would be buying each one of them and if they cant buy you, they will kill you, so after your leader has been bought and your leader says lets 'dialogue' and you are still protesting, its you who they will come for, because you are going against the agreement with your 'leader'.

The longer Tuto stays in power, the more he consolidates his power. The more dangerous things become.
Can you imagine the deoravity spreading for another 2 years??

I agree that the youth, the Gen Zote cannot remain leaderless. “appointing” leaders is dangerous, yes. Because they immediately become targets. Targets for murder and abductions. Targets for bribe.
But for the sake of organisation, for the sake of organizing, for the sake of treading the same path, at some point, there has tonbegrænsningen a or several leaders. And yes, it will be a dangerous time.

#NAME?,❤Lyn informative show
#NAME?,Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
#NAME?,William Ruto is not a good guy😢 he knows that tribalism can create a civil war but it doesnt matter to him as long as he gets to remain in power
#NAME?,So when Gachagua screams everyday chanting 'usiguze murima' is not tribalism but when Kalenjin Step in to defend Ruto is Tribalism...Sheer hypocrisy...Wacha ukabila katambe..Fake Gen Z
#NAME?,​@@dixonkiplimo4534 wewe ongea tuu. WANTAM😊

#NAME?,Great job lynn❤❤❤
#NAME?,"Great job, Lynn, for creating the space for the youth to speak their minds. 👍🏽"
#NAME?,Welcome 😊
#NAME?,"Lynn Ngugi remains unmatched in fearless reporting! Ruto’s regime is visibly crumbling under the weight of Gen Z’s bold resistance. The youth are rejecting tribal manipulation, demanding accountability and justice instead. 
Kenyans are waking up, refusing to be divided along ethnic lines. Kudos to Lynn for shining a light on this powerful movement and amplifying real voices..."
#NAME?,Thank you for your feedback
#NAME?,​@@LynnNgugiGod Bless you dear for the wonderful job u doing
#NAME?,"I support this discussion, bright minds, and I totally agree the Parliament has FAILED Kenyans. Ruto is trying to divide Kenyans through tribal lines and that's not our portion in Jesus mighty name Amen. Our children are not tribal at all they just want the right governance, which has totally failed. My prayers continue for Kenya. To all the Gsz, you are more than conquerers in Christ Jesus and don't loose hope. As a mother am down on my knees. ISAIAH 54 V 17 NO WEAPON FORGED AGAINST YOU SHALL PROSPER."
#NAME?,Soon or later this  youths shall take power by force from those old puppet of western nations.
#NAME?,"Tribal manipulation has been the main winning chip in these house of cards which is now crumbling, and politicians in both political divide are not happy because people are now realizing the tribal bluff is what has put us in this bad situation, that's why instead of Ruto addressing serious issues like audit of public debt, corruption and extrajudicial killings he plays the tribal bluff by bringing Raila and he is not happy because as Kenyans we have seen through that bluff!. Rigathi and his wamunyoro bregade are also playing the same card of tribal bluff yet he also knowns that we can see through his filthy lies and deep down he also knows that just because we have a common enemy does not make us friends. All these fools in both political divide must go."
#NAME?,"True.  Both sides deploy ethnic manipulation for political gain. The difference and imbalance arises from one side having a monopoly of ""legitimate"" violence and unlimited resources."
#NAME?,The politicians don't like Ruto but they like the money that he gives them.I💯 concur with this
#NAME?,"I was coincidentally thinking about this just a couple hours ago. Ruto has been on a wealth acquisition spree... over the last couple of months, longstanding court cases surrounding his pieces of land have been strangely dropped in quick succession e.g the 1650-acre Ruai land, and KCAA has suddenly dropped the position they have held for over a decade, that Weston Hotel sits on land that has been grabbed from them.

But despite all this property (a minimum of 10,000 acres of land, and even more like the 5 high-end helicopters he acquired as DP), many Kenyans don't respect him fundamentally. And his own associates (at the moment) have contributed to this, by continually labeling him a corrupt thief, over at least 2 decades. That's the image we have in our minds, even when he randomly produces KShs. 1.2b of his own money for a dubious project.

Were he to lose his questionable wealth, those around him would not last 2 years."
#NAME?,@@kenyann4906I hear they  are even printing money to do the dirt works.
#NAME?,Ruto needs to be informed that divided and Conquer      will never work again in Kenya. We are moving forward United as one Kenya. He can only fool himself by setting his blame to Kikuyus.
#NAME?,"What I find interesting is that the MPs claiming to be in opposition are pleading with us to wait till 2027. None of them has dared to table a motion to impeach the president. It tells you one thing: all of them have a price and are just as compromised as Ruto, whom they claim they want to oust through the ballot. Kenyans, we are on our own, and we need to drain the swamp. None of them should make it back to parliament."
#NAME?,Thank you for bringing them on set. I love love the energy the Genzs carry with them. Please take good care of yourselfs this nation needs you our loved ones.
#NAME?,We need a lot of Prayers wisdom on OUR YOUTHS ARE DIEING OLDER WOMEN MEN ARE SLEEPING IN KENYA WAKE UP PLEASE!

#NAME?,We need Revolution period! And I am using my menses wisely not discarding them in pads anymore.  Ladies and maamas it time to Curse this people using the blood of our womb. It's powerful. Every month take your menses in a clean basin put an intention to it. The intention can be good or bad then command mother nature to deal with them while you poor on the ground. You can also apply on the forehead . Command mother nature to deal with this neocons as we fight for our Kenya and Africa.The bad intentions are directed to Ruto and his regime and also to those who are pulling the strings above Ruto. It's now. If we as mothers do this they will fall and we will save Kenya. This is a spiritual fight . Politics and Religion will not Save Kenya. Spiritual fight and Revolution is what we need. Our menses are more powerful than missiles and bombs. Trust the Universe and act accordingly.

#NAME?,Very true.
#NAME?,"Very true, anybody with any case of deaths or like-minded Individual under their service is not to be trusted for change. Two brothers died in Kianjokoma Embu, and many more in Nakuru and Matiangi defied court Orders. Either we allow them to shape us out, or they will shape us up. I still go with Maraga for president, and I don't have any other option. Kalonzo has been Kamba's Colonizer since 1985! with many accusation of longtime Nepotism with his closest allies to luxurius civil service Jobs. Eugene is a beneficiary of the well-capable H.E. Kijana wa Malwa's death in a senior Position and has no reformist idea he could offer. Thomas Isidore Sankara once said that the ideas of a revolutionary can be perceived. Be ready to make mad! Radical decisions or your sweetheart's choice of presidency will make you run banana. Apologies for the lengthy opinion, though."

7JwKc6r5fAQ,May God bless you Juliet and give you strength to watch over your parents and those kids. So  sad😭😢
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"On Kitui accident, I have  watched the videos of the victims before , during and after the deadly ""cross over"" and am personally blaming nobody for the accident ; am going to give my reason.

 Before the accident, I watched a video of the jovial passengers practicing on how they were going to match at whichever wedding they were heading to. Ladies dressed in green and men in yellow. 

There was life in them, happiness and most importantly hopes and anticipation for what was before them. Laughter here and there, jokes, admiration and generally love.

Then the next video was them in a bus, slowly moving towards what would be the last moment for most of them. Their life was solely on the hands on one hero by the name of a driver , gambling with his wheels on where to roll. 

With a simple miss, they were going down and just like that , the precious lives were lost.

In the last video, I watched their lifeless bodies being paraded by the side of the river moments before they were taken to the mortuary. The same people full of life minutes before and dancing were there paraded like sacks.

Usually I tell people that when death comes and has been loudly called , the best doctors would make mistakes of their lifetime ; the best  drivers would forget where the brakes are ; the best soldiers would unknowingly  expose their heads for the bullet and the most careful people would outrightly risk.

This was such a case. Let's not start analysing how the driver was wrong or how the passengers risked their lives. Remember this was not the first vehicle going through this bridge at that state ; there were others that had passed through there successfully before .

Death is never cured by being careful. In some instances, the most careful people die and the most careless  survive. Street kids who eat from the dustbins least die of corona or even cholera while the people who observe hygiene to the fullest do. 

These people had their last DANCE which most of you would never have before your death ; their last RIDE and ultimate REST. There is always no mistake in God's decision however painful it is.

 We usually don't know what is before us when we wake up - however careful you might be , you might still end up dying because of someone's else negligence. 

That is LIFE. We don't  QUESTION.

May the departed souls find peace in their next life🙏"
7JwKc6r5fAQ,TRUE
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"Sad to watch, this family is in my warm thoughts and prayers. She is such a strong lady to narrate this tragic story, i applaud her🙏"

7JwKc6r5fAQ,"This was an uncalled for death! I watched it before it happened and was screaming; do not cross with a bus full of people! The driver of the bus was an idiot. The families in that bus should have known better. I am a swimmer with a first place medal in high school freestyle and under no circumstances will I risk my life like that. I’m sincerely sorry that such a preventable situation was completely ignored. Before the crossing, my husband said” one must walk through the river and if it is not possible by foot(WATER MUST BE BELOW THE KNEES). If not DO NOT CROSS."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,My heartfelt condolences.May God our creator see this Family through all the days of their life

7JwKc6r5fAQ,"Sad indeed.  Of importance is that something is done about building a lasting bridge across that river.  Kenya is rich in resources, including sand from the very same river that can be used to rebuild.  Let this experience not go in vain. Let more lives not be lost."

7JwKc6r5fAQ,I come from ukambani and I have never understood why all bridges are built flat on the river. It doesn't make sense. This is the most difficult interview I have ever watched. May the Lord continue to comfort the family. Thank you Lynn for covering this story.
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"There are several reasons as to why drifts are constructed instead of bridges.first there is economic value of the area, two most rivers around this place are seasonal, most of times they are dry and thirdly, drifts are constructed to serve two purposes; traffic passage and also act as a reservoir, storing water upstream for use during dry spells."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,The cause of the accident is corruption in part of government.
7JwKc6r5fAQ,This story is so sad am even crying .DEAR GOD HEAL THIS ONE FOR ME .AMEN . lyn may God bless you .to the MUTUAs you going to stand again strong in jesus name .AMEN .

7JwKc6r5fAQ,So sad indeed 😢
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"May be all this was sacrifice so that a person can get a seat of leadership or whatever else, its work of darkness sacrificing souls. People, turn to Jesus and accept him as your saviour because, no person who is not born again will enter heaven. Jesus tells Nicodemus in John 3:3 "" UNLESS you are born again, you CANNOT ENTER heaven"", Nicodemus marvels and wonder how that is possible but Jesus tells him, its the only way.  John 3:16 ""for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that WHOSOEVER believes in him shall not PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE"", so, the result of believing in Jesus or what shows that you have believed in him is accepting him as your Lord and saviour which is = born again. So, believing alone is not enough, even devil believes, difference is, are you born again?. After being born again, you get the fruits of the holy spirit i.e as per Galatians 5:22. So, you no longer live but Jesus lives in you cos ur born again so sinful nature is not in you. If you are born again, yours is Galatians 5:22, if you are just a christian and have the fruits in Galatians 5:19-21, then you are a candidate for hell fire. No confusion good people, being born again IS A MUST!"

7JwKc6r5fAQ,The politicians are busy eating the money from public coffers. What they don’t realise is all those lost lives are on them. It is a curse they will never recover from. Kenyan politicos think they are smart. Shock on them and their descendants. Better to die poor then have that blood money.
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"Lynn you are a very wise journalist. Your calling is divine and that's why you wear empathy in your heart to do the things you do.

7JwKc6r5fAQ,"Am truly sadden by the whole story,  my sympathy to the whole family.I am questioning myself listening to the lady stating this river have been killing people over the year or should we say life time. What has the county leaders have been doing when they are elected by the people to help and support them in their county. The truth is leaders are employed by the people when you elected them and people should realise they are answerable to the people. This problem should be addressed, it ashamed still anything hasn't been done in that area after such incident. It shows lack of human values to the country."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,Is a very sad scene we saw but may the Almighty God continue giving them strength at this sad days of there  loved ones

7JwKc6r5fAQ,"People should not always blame the government why close such a dangerous river, we have commonsense we need to use them.,the government can build a bridge but we need to be careful with the decision we take."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"Infact its better to go longer route than risk this much. However, it has happened and we can only pray that God comfort the families."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"I console with the family but still advice my people to avoid functions during rainy seasons and  whenever travelling to use different/separate  means ,not  all family members packing into one vehicle....remember we used to hear years back that the then living brothers of coca cola company who knew the ""formula "" never would board one plane for both,to avoid the untold story to unfold on the company should they die in a crash🤔."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,That's was very insensitive statements to the family you cannot cure death. The safest routes ever on Earth cause accidents.

7JwKc6r5fAQ,"I tire of such attitudes. Nothing spiritual eh! There’s no bridge, build a bridge and if it continues come let us talk spiritual. I fear there’s no cure for irrationality in Africa. A flooded river with no bridge but that will it push us to demand better from our leaders.  I guess stating it’s spiritual is an easy fix because it only demands words against a non existent force. But if we won’t demand actions against our leaders because that requires real effort. I pity Kenyan children!!!"
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"As Mary said,it needs a bridge. There's nothing spiritual here.it keeps happening because its never fixed."
7JwKc6r5fAQ,"So sad, our heavenly father will give you more strength to cope with the situation"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I have always postponed watching this story. I am an avid follower of Lynn Ngugi and more so Tales of Wanjiku. This is by far the most heartbreaking story I have watched. Am innocent soul breathing their last at the hands of a deadbeat father, heartless in-laws, corrupt medical and justice systems. Truly may God who gives justice to the voiceless do so for Mama Kingsley. The pain is visible and touchable, as a viewer my heart is sunken and only wish her nothing but the best. If you have a family, more so kind, plead the blood of Jesus Christ over them, cover them with Spirit filled hedge of fire that cannot be broken. Yaani, I have never shed this much tears from such stories. The last of such pain I now feel is like what I gfelt when I lost my dad to ESRD on 14/10/2020 Justice will be served no matter how long it takes. 
#JusticeforbabyKingsley"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,May GOD in Heaven wipe your tears away and avenge the death of your innocent son. We pray for you mama Kingsley
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is painful.I think the 2000 this guy was told to be giving for the support of the child made him kill the child.That is why it is advisable to all women after separation with the father of your children pls don't force the father to support them because a willing father will automatically support them.This guy had just come on a mission to finish the kid so that he can get a relief from sending the 2000 monthly support.A man who does not love you will never ever love your kids.Corruption which is in this country has denied justice for many but the God of justice will never let this guy and his generation and whoever participated in denying justice for baby Kingsley have peace even in their grave .We demand justice for Kingsley and the mother!
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I am so sorry
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Surely is toching story.akh only justice needed

_b6D5wMzKZQ,😭 did she get justice? @LynnNgugi
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Why would he kill an innocent 1 year old? This is so heartbreaking...I was scared of watching,  but I did. I really empathise with this mum. Whether justice will be delivered or not in the courts, this man will never have peace. He will always pay for his actions. I can only imagine what went through his heart when Lynn Ngugi asked him ""Wewe ndio baba Kingsline?""
OH GOD! AM HEARTBROKEN😭😭😭"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,He did not want to pay the mandated child support.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Oh God. Might he have done this coz alireportiwa kwa children's office? And the way she's hardworking hadi anajianzishia kabiashara. Oh God of the voiceless, please take charge."

He said the difference between a man and an animal in the bush is that a man comes back home in the evening. And in this case you see there are many who choose not to even come home to you. So so sad we live in a world where many things are a mystery, they simply have no explanation. May God comfort all who have been broken in the name of searching for love and support 😌"

I have finally gathered courage to watch it and in deed I have never cried this like.  The pain Winfred is going through only God can heal.  So many  government departments fail us, from the police, to the hospital to the doctors.  Where do we go for justice.  The parents of this man behaved like they have never had a child.  This was chilling haki.  Winnie we will pray for you and as you say, God is the voice of voiceless.  Pole sana mummy.  I had to pose so many times when the the emotions were too much for me to bear."

I pray Justice prevails for kingsley.
May God comfort Ms Karambu
Lastly i curse that man who decided he was God and could kill king so as to avoid paid child support. May he never know peace, may all his children die in similar pain and may he never know the joy of fatherhood he doesnt deserve it. He is evil!
Amen"

This cant be left as a mere story"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,May God restore you girl. you carry a huge burden. Jesus Christ unburden this girls heart. Its tooo much
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This man will never have peace we curse his actions in Jesu's name,, we cursed him with his whole generation"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is too much to hold..my he never know peace in Jesus name 😭😭😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Sister God is with you. Is too painful, all this words from people cursing that men, he will really suffer his time will come, his time will come. And u will One day shine my lady.
Grate is God, he can do the impossible , possible. Watch and u will see , just have Patience . We feel with you as mothers as women and some good men in this world feel with you and we all pray the best for you dear. Everything will be fine. You will not have the same baby , but you will have wonderful kids ain Shaa Allah. Amin."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I mean how can the parents protect a muder? Yes he is their son, but as a mother how can u pay a doctor to bring wrong results out? The mother should know if the son did not do anything, why do he have to pay a doctor to say lies? He paid because he knew he was guilty, he knew he did something bad , he knew that he was wrong. And that’s why I don’t like some lawyers, if that lawyer of his saw the truth, and he hide it just to get paid, May God punish him as well, because he could atlist fight for him to get few years in jail for what he did, but not to fake things, Oh God you really told us in your holy Books that they will be such people and it’s true we see them. 
God will lift you up girl, you are still young, May Almity God bless you with a very good men, a God fearing men, a men who will make you happy for the rest of your life in this world and here after, a men who will be praying with you and be praying for Kingsley everyday, and May God bless you with healthy baby Twins. 2X Amen.
You feel pain let your tears out whenever u feel to cry, cry, never hold back, that’s the healing proses, God is with you. Everything happens with reason. God loves you very much. Be strong in prayers. Maybe God wanted you to go more closer to Him. Be strong in praying, thank God for everything, as Him to stand for you and ask Him for blessings. Cry to God cry to Him , He hears, He sees you, He will answer you when u don’t expect . 
That men will never find peace in his life, the thing he did. will follow him always, in him will never be a truly happiness in his life till his death. He has to confess . He has to say the truth and turn to God. Without that, him, his Father, his mother, and everyone who helped him to do bad and hide evil, they will suffer, and that Satan who lied them, will not stand with them the day of judgment and they will regret listening to the devil. Am so angry of this even our government back home, that some judges who can’t do there Kobe well although  they see something is not right. One hour am living my healthy child home, and when I come back he is dead and the men who is never there with me, says the child was having ammonia ? How for just one hour? Is he a doctor to diagnose the child? 
Am so sorry for our poor Gavament seeing the parent with a dead child and still they let a mother curry her child alone with hands to the moturery ? How? What kind of doctors are there? Just saying ice cold, we can’t do anything the child is dead, but atlist keep the mother there and call the car to bring the child away. Oh my God, I can’t live in that country for real."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Ooh ya Allah am making my Dua (prayers) to this lady (mama Kingsley) May your Son have the highest Rank in  Jannathul Firdaus , May he live in peace there till you 2 meet again. 
I have cried a lot , I felt her pain the moment she stoped talking when she wanted to say what happened to her baby when she came back home. My dear sister you are a women and that men made you shade the tears and in Islam no men should make a women cry because God counts every drop of tear which a women drops and for those tears a men suffers a lot. God is with you my sister He saw everything He knows everything, God saw what happened, so that men may hide what he did to your son to this world and to the humanity , but he has to know, on that moment he made his plan to come to you and do something to your son, God new everything, the moment he was doing what he was doing, God saw everything, he may thought he was alone killing or do bad thing to an angle of God, but he was not, God was there, if he really killed the boy , which we can’t say because only God knows and we just see from the Story u told us , we think he has done it , but who is 100% knows the truth is God and he. 
But, I am telling you my sister , as Islam says, if u kill one innocent human being, no matter what religion what tribe, what rase, is as if u have killed the whole humanity. 
So he may live but he has to know and live with that for the rest of his life that he have killed the whole humanity. 
We pray for justice. And I say how can a men do evil because of money, according to your words, you said , that doctor who kept on telling u he was paid, so he was paid to say the wrong thing? How can someone do that because of money and he sees that that men has killed a human being?
Do this world really has come to end? Because we see all this signs of the devil. People do not think the life after death anymore, where are they going to go? What are they going to answer on the day of judgment ? Am crying, 😢😭😭 am really very sad for this 😣. That men is to fear, please lady’s mark the face of that men, a devil can have a human body, devils lives with us in this world. Please never bring any child in this world with that men, That men will never change. And his family are also bad,"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Divine thee,  consider the tears of this woman. It is too much for her soul to accept. Let her soul and spirit be uplifted and her physical life receive smiles of your greatness. Greatness for justice and restoration, twice to be specific. It is not my flesh and blood,  but my troubled soul and spirit calling Divine power for that. Ooh,  thee,  thank you because you hear."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Look how hopeless nd painful she is
God grant this mother healing 

I have never cried this much 😪😪
#justicetobabykingsley"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Ooh God.... console thc lady😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I have never had courage to watch this video but i was able to after watching the followup.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,mid 2023 is way too far! Wait and see the lord's doings!
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May he never have a child his entire!!This is very heartbreaking 💔 May God comfort this mom hugs girl you are still beautiful and amazing ❤God will give you a man who will love and value you,and you will have more fruits of your womb❤❤❤❤❤❤"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God knows our tears ... We have cried painfully. Mungu kumbuka mtoto wako, mfute machozi"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May God almighty heal her I can feel her pain
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May Lord evenge the family
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This man Will never know peace
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May those involved never find peace.  So sad
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"1. This man had another family
, sadly, you were a side chic. His reaction about the pregnancy should have been a red flag.
2. This man is a monster, he probably eliminated the boy to avoid child support. Such a evil man.
3. Its too late but i wish you had cut him off completely you wouldn’t have suffered forever."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,so painful
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Looo!!! Jesus Christ
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"That monster will pay dearly one day, may God comfort this girl and give her strength and hope to stand again."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I needed to be psychologically prepared to watch this. May God avenge every innocent blood spilt and every blameless life cut short at the hand of monsters. People who kill others forget that we all answer to a higher power. When they think that they can bribe and threaten to evade justice, God cannot be bribed, intimidated or threatened. Our tears are not in vain. God will fight for us and give us justice in the courts of man and in the courts of heaven. That family will never know peace, it shall never be well with any of them now and for generations to come. Vita zingine ni za Mungu tu. Oh Lord our God fight for us"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Am sooooo heartbroken....God be with u and give u peace mummy.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God will make a way mama king.he is God.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Watching this after the update interview and I am in awe. There is really light at the end of tunnel, no matter how dark it is. 🖤"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Amen
_b6D5wMzKZQ,All I can say I will keep u in prayers my beautiful sister..
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Thank you Lyn Ngugi for the great work you are doing in helping the voiceless in our community. The cynicism and disregard of life that some Kenyans have must be urgently addressed. E.g., the matron who helped Winifred and later did not inform her about not taking the child's body....what happened to her to change her mind; the callous 2nd doctor who told the grieving mother to ""chinja mtoto wako"", the heartless Morris Mutuma, refusing to talk to Lyn, arrested and released, no bribe money is worth that helpless child. Justice for Kingsley, his mother and her parents!! When professionals act like this for whatever reason... the matron, the 2nd doctor (pathologist??) the court not addressing Winifred's first autopsy, the police releasing this suspect probably to do this again? where is the country heading?"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Let the killer lack peace at all
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May justice prevail
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Oh God of heaven? How the cries of your people reach out to you.
The children of Israel cried of the oppressive hand.
God intervene in this issue.
God intervene in this issue.
God of heavens"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I hate men,I really hate men walai 🥺"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Pole sana Winifred for your pain. Such a heart rending story of a monster who clearly had a motive to kill this beautiful child (after paying Kshs 2,000 for child care). I feel Winifred's unfathomable pain at the thought of how King died, helplessly brutally and needlessly butchered by the person supposed to take care of him. I hope this man is arrested and rots in jail"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Sorry
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The last time I cried like this is when my brother was killed by officers in a cold blood in 2021,my God of voiceless come through for this lady,have really cried,am having a bad headache may that man lot in hell 😭😭😭"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Pole Saaana
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"It s painful....
The pain is unbearable....😭"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"That man will never know what is peace,you will pay deeply,you will never ever be in peace you evil man,God of Ibrahim will styk you ,you will die lyk dog,that pain am feeling for this innocent girl you will not go far am telling you."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Some people just come to your life with a calculated mission to accomplish. They already have a decision deep down in their hearts. Choose humans, not evils"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Heh
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Xry
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Oh my God! See her through.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,As a single mother ile uchungu nimeskia😭😭the painful tears nimeshed 😭😭I can only emagn what she went and what she is going through 😭😭😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This young girl is very intelligent!
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Aki Lynn find that Doctor so he can be shamed for his behaviour. This people who replace justice with bribe , should be jailed. Consolata hospital matron was bribed. She is equally guilty. She should go to jail with him."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Why the innocent kid??? Can't control my tears. May you find justice again Mamaa
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Pole sana mum ,it's so painful tears from eyes oh no justice must prevail for the innocent child he doesn't deserve such painful death😭😭😭😭😪😪"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"What a sad and painful story. Lynn thanks for this lady's story, God has her justice. I will do my part."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The dad is the devil himself only ksh.2000 inafanya aue mtoi coz that is the cause

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Oh my God, how did we as human beings sink this low?

This is by far the saddest story I have had to . Look at how inconsolable Winnie is, the pain is still raw and fresh."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Mum Kingsley take heart.God is watching.this.justice will be prevailed
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Hugs my darling😭 😭😭😭😭😭 love from Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God comfort this lady , ni uchungu sana. pole sana mummy, as a parent you can literally go insane. God of Justice come and take control. That man will never have peace in his life same to his extended family.....i pray"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,It is for sure that the guy had a mission even though he had a lawyer but our God is the maker of all lawyers and HE himself will surely be your lawyer he might think he has won but the is no longer in your hands but your maker will for u just trust and have faith dear sister.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"His own blood, human have become more heartless 💔...not even an animal can do this to his own baby....no matter what...I feel the mom's pain trying to see and feel how his son died,how painful it was...poor boy...as an angel 😇 u are now,be a protector to ua mom,she loved you more...hugs 💙 winnie,justice for your son will one day prevail"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Surely I personally believe there is God in heaven who truly lives and is a God of justice this has reminded me of the story in the bible about a woman who stole another persons baby and was supporting the judges to cut the baby into two the lord surely lives he will fight for you be strong my dear.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I have cried one hour..😭😭😭.This man will never know peace😭😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May he lack peace in his entire life
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I have really cried🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺this is so wicked 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 you wish you knew ohhhhhhh LORD🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Who else thinks this stupid man decided to kill the son when he was taken to child support office ?so that he can end giving out his money .may he rot in jail and may he die a miserable death. Am so hurt
_b6D5wMzKZQ,My thoughts too
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I don’t always leave comments but Winnie’s story is terribly hurtful. This lady has gone through hell pain. As she narrated her story I felt the pain myself and cried. That man is evil and should be behind bars. Winnie needs psychological support as she is now blaming herself
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Really  painful momma 😭😭😭😭😭..There is  a God in heaven who reveals everything   in his time.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Na hili jibaba liko kwingine likidanganya wanawake wengine....may justice prevail

For the part of not releasing the body ,thats a court order ,if she wants justice  it had to be complied with.
This is almost a straight case but system is fucked  up.

I feel you mum . 😢 😭 😿"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"At times i feel satan comes in form of a man ,from the story the man was ""something else"" from beginning but this young mum kept giving him chances hoping things will work ,little did she know that she was taking in the devil.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This is the most painful story l have ever watched. 
Who does that????
 killing your own son in order not to pay child support .He should have just walked away and never look back. 
God you're the only one who can heal this young lady's 🙏."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"#justiceforbabyKingley# The first time I told my boyfriend I was pregnant for him he told me to remove it. Few weeks later I lied to him that have aborted the pregnancy and he started getting closer to me again trying to tell me that I should give him about 2 yrs and that he will get me pregnant again, and that by that time he will be prepared for a baby... when I got to be 5 months of my pregnancy I broke the news to him that I was still pregnant for him and that was the last time  I heard from him . After watching what Winnie has gone through no day will I  ever let that man come close to see my child. Due to He had no interest from beginning and I guess he will never had. Winnie mama am so sorry for the loss of baby 🤴 👑 King. Remember we have a God that they can never Honga like the way they honga the morgue. Love you Winnie and God bless!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"And you wonder why there is no rain, eapecially in Meru, a land known to be fertile n bumper harvests, God is angry with this land. An innocent soul is crying 😢,  King and many others. There is no peace, the soil, the rivers, the forests...nature is polluted and abused, all filled with murdered  bodies. It is not well until well  repent n give justice where due. I fact, let God give justice to this lady n baby King. But even if this man had another family, King never deserved this. I suspect this man n the whole family are in some cult....ritualists."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Unaenda aji Kwa duka 1hr. 
1hr nkitoka Thika kuenda Nairobi na kurudi. Mum pole Kwa kupoteza mtoi.
Is he the real father?. Coz is had for me to believe a man can do this to his own blood son😥😢😥😢"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Watched this episode immediately it aired, still thinking about this lady and trying to just figure out how the dad strangled his own flesh and blood without feeling guilty, I can't seem to get an answer for this, could this be because he was once summoned for the childs upkeep? If it's so i wish he could have just disappeared from the sons life and never show up, because he's going to pay more than a billion times. That was an innocent kid. He will pay dearly. Vegeance belongs to the Lord. He will take care of this case ."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Very sad. People can be really heartless. Lynn, please give us a follow up."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This guy's family has something they are hiding. looks like  the father advised the son to kill the child as a best and fastest  way of removing the child from the picture so that he does not have a child attached to him. He conspired with the hospital so who ever is invol ved should be suede plus the hospital. Even the father should be arrested because from the beginning he denied that the son doesnt know her and the child so how come he organized the burial of a child he was not aware about? #JusticeforbabyKingsley. MHSRP
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May God remember you, God fight the battle for you Mama King. May He strengthen you, and comfort you and your support system, especially your parents.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I really feel for the lady and i would wish the lady wouldn't have allowed the guy to her house. This guy will not have peace in his life may God punish him day in and day out.
Also, i blame some of the facilities that we have in our country, how comes the lady was at the mortuary the day before clearing and nobody informed the lady? Do they know the cost of burial? Even you doctors, no money is enough to fabricate a report involving death cases. Assume the child was yours, assume your daughter goes through the same.., and assume your grandchild faces the same. Is the money enough to cover the rest of your family because what goes around comes around?
If the guy had nothing to do with the child, why did he report pneumonia as the cause when he had no health history of the kid?."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,So true..its so painful..
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May God fill her heart with peace & hope.Yes there is a God in heaven ambaye hahongwi.

I wish that evil man God will punish in such a way that he wish he was dead .Am crying so much right now 😭😭😭😭 God do justice for this lady don't let that wicked man walk Scot-free the human jail let him walk out .See how he is happy walking out ,put him in your jail .I know that a day is coming when that man and his family will wail and they will shed tears of blood.The plaques  that will befall that man's family we be more painful than the plaques that befall Egypt.By the time God is done with him he will wish for death . That man is evil I hate seeing his image it's as if am looking at a demon and not human 
He looks like a human but inside he is a snaring beast .How can he  do this to his own son just how ,I now know demons walk among humans just that we can't see them.I still fathom all this ."

The man is like a quack doctor he has thoroughly researched how to kill & made sure that he will do it in such a way that the mother will be drowning in sadness that she will not even rem to talk when the Dr asks what happened hapo ndio alianza kujenga his defence may he never find peace may that baby's face haunt him for the rest of his life. Uchungu ilioje. Na akaweka mwili akijua he's the only one who can remove him na that's what happens  another thing he evilly planned alijua what he did may his brains rot in hell.
Than he hammered it in by a second pathologists report he should have attended the first na polisi waitwe hapo ndipo alitoboa another loophole the guy is a true murder it reads like a movie script"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Divine healing to this soul ooh Lord.Hugs beautiful girl .God will surely restore you for he's Just.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"😭😭😭God may You remember mama Kingsley,  she has soo many questions why all this happened and You alone God    have the answers. May You visit her and her family, comfort them, let Your peace guard their minds and hearts as they wait upon You to avenge for them. You say where 2 or 3 gather together in Your name, there in their midst You are.  We as LNN family all over the world stand with Winnie's family in pray for justice for her son. We believe that You have already heard our cries and You will bring her enemies to shame and destruction.  May they never know peace for they selfishly and intentionally desired to destroy Winnie.  As to my single mums out there ( am a  single mum too) ,choose peace for you and your kids.  If God gave you those kids, HE had already provided enough for you and your kids.  This sudden attitude of giving second chances to toxic exes and absent fathers  will only bring you pain and regrets.  OUR GOD IS A GOOD FATHER FOR YOU AND YOUR KIDS, TRUST HIM AND ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES IN GLORY HE WILL PROVIDE FOR US💕"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,My country Kenya has chosen corruption and denied innocent mothers Justice. when we are called shit hole countries that allows murderers to walk free after killing innocent babies.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I wish we had power to wake up the dead
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God may you heal her, 😭😭.#Justicefor Munene. May God revenge for you and your family."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"So emotional Lynn😢😢😢😢,"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"It's a cold morning, its a long walk, shops aren't quite open yet, except one of the butchers began setting up shop. That gave the guy ample time to proceed in the murder of his child, it could be by blocking the air passage through the baby's nostrils from breathing, their not used to breathing from the mouth. The man is demonic to the point of putting the child in an extreme state of fear.
He premeditated this crime, I suspect he paid doctor in advance to cover-up the causes and deny the mother access from possible autopsy and to quickly bury the evidence. 
Governments,  Officials would sell their soul for money. The children suffer. The people suffer, Women are raised to do as they're told, as though they have no use of their brain.
She is a self made business woman who manage on her own. 
Wait on the Lord and pray and ask Him, seek Him, knock and the door will be opened. 
Remember the Book of Job in the Bible. God will bountiful bless you. The breath of her baby is in the hands of God, when Jesus returns she and baby will be reunited in heaven. Amen Jesus."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I’m finally watching this episode as a single mom who left an abuser. I pray she finds peace and Justice ! I pray she is rewarded for her suffering. I pray these people are held accountable. I pray that mothers will not be made to try to accept men just because they are the biological parent 😊
_b6D5wMzKZQ,being a married man somewhere is no reason to kill this innocent soul who didn't ask to be born. my condolences to her and may Allah help us get justice.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This lady's tears are not in vain.May this evil monster never know peace.May he never get any other son apart from Kingsley.He's doomed!!
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God is with you my daughter these people will have no peace at all.

The eyes of the Lord are everywhere and the tears of this young mother and her broken heart, God will vindicate for her. Remember, money can not buy everything! Mama Kingsley, continue looking unto God and He will wipe away your tears. Kingsley is gone to be with the Lord. May the Lord build your faith and forcus on God  and at the end of age, you will see your son again. May the Lord give the court wisdom and bring the hidden truth.  Baba Kinsley, repent for your evil deed of shedding innocent blood which is crying before his maker. Remember, nothing hidden in this world and in the hearts of men, shall not be punished and judged by God. May the Lord give Mama Kingsley healing that comes from Him alone.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,God of vengeance avail Yourself in this case!
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Just too painful, just too painful.. Mungu inuka umpiganie huyu mama, may the Lord give you peace, The moment I saw the title I knew I wasn't ready to watch this painful torture.. The God you have called in tears will answer you by fire.. That man and the entire family will never know no peace...! Oh lord of heaven just arise for your daughter 's sake.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Justice comes from the Lord God.
He formed this kid in his mother's womb,  He God knew the beginning and end of this child..all is left for God to fight for this lady.
May all that are connected to the death of this boy be answered by his maker.  
What goes round comes round...God have mercy."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is the most painful story I have watched oooooo my God may this lady get justice and may God give her peace
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Woiiii I shade tears and as a single mom I have learnt something to do with comeback baby daddies though too painful may she find justice.Lynn you're such a strong lady
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Woiiii I shade tears and as a single mom I have learnt something to do with comeback baby daddies though too painful may she find justice.Lynn you're such a strong lady
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Whenever there is an unexplained death of a child there should be a serious inquest to establish the failure. There don’t seem to have courts hearing in this case. We now have a culprit free out there and capable of repeating the same thing to another person. Another failure from systems that should be protecting children.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Lynn how did it go?was he arrested?
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Hey Lynn can we get the progress on this case
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Mama Kingsley be assured of God's vengeance .God is never bribed and that man will face God's wrath.soo disturbing
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Woooie God see this woman through 🥺 fight for her coz I believe that there is nothing that is impossible with you my God
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Thank you Lynn for bringing this to light! First; this guy will never know peace from today. Secondly ambia msichana asijali, everyone who was involved in covering this will be arrested and charged and justice shall be served! They, their homes and their people will never know peace from today as long as that child is dead. Let them know there so many ways of finding peace and they are delivered in many ways. Tunafuata zote tena taratibu. 

Lastly, I speak peace to this girl from today. May God restore your loss. You will heal and you will get King back just as the other one and everytime you look at him you will know peace. You will never again cry because of this life. Your turn around is permanent.

IT IS WELL!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Justice for Mama Kingsley this one so painful that Man he is heartless , wicked. where is human rights in our Country? ... Where is government ?"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Amen

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Don't worry. God will replace many more kings. Trust in him. He gives and take. He's listening and is with you in all this pain. He's the king of kings and will deal with the murderer.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,the pain is too much to bear........can we help her get justice ?
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I’m Believing this guy is into a Cult club he sacrificed his child since he was a so called ‘Pastor ‘  false man of God in order to get Power and wealth from his Ministry God will remember you Mamy even if justice doesn’t prevail in the court Just know our God is a justice God whoever Kills always has a mark on him like Cain
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Aky hii story iko touching bt God is incontrol, hav no much to say nmefeel ka mama aky pole sana, Mungu n mweza ya yote"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The first postmortem is very true. He's a killer. His family shouldn't protect a killer. He will also butcher them.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,He's a serial killer. Should be eliminated from society. The government should take serious interest in this case and isolate him before he destroys other lives. This is an eye opener. Days of killers are numbered. May God keep King in safe hands and strengthen the mum and grand parents and many of us who have followed this untold painful story.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,What is making me more mad is someone who has never been or bother about the child now him and the family planning and fighting for the body to bury not knowing the blood in their hands will haunt them forever.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,My God My God let wipe her tears and envelope her within your big arms - lay a table before Her pursuers

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"@lynn I wish you'd had a medical expert to help dissect the 2 post mortems....
Let me explain a few things:
1. The cause of death as per the first post mortem which is asphyxiation secondary to suffocation doesn't necessarily mean the child was suffocated by someone. It can be a natural cause. Even cot death (which is mentioned as the possible cause of death is the second post mortem) causes death via asphyxiation. Some signs that asphyxiation occurred is the fluid in the lungs and what they are calling ""epicardial petechiae"" which are small bruises on the lining of the heart. So essentially the 2 are not saying very different things in actuality. 

2. Poor communication from medics is probably a reason why she didn't understand the post mortem from the perspective of the second pathologist. I also feel like his conclusion was inaccurate because he had some bias... The cause of death is not unascertained. It is asphyxiation (sudden hypoxia) in both cases. What is unascertained is the manner of death (whether is was a natural death or a homicidal death ie murder). 

3. I have not heard from the post mortem mention of other signs of struggle or foul play. The hyoid bone is outrightly mentioned (in the second post mortem). That is a bone in the neck. It breaks if a person is strangulated. If it is intact it is unlikely strangulation. There are other signs. Were there bruises around the nose and mouth and face (suffocation by pillow or hand), around the neck (strangulation), around the chest with broken ribs or sternum (pressure to the chest)? Those would be what would be evidence that the suffocation was caused by foul play and this is what should be looked for in the reports, or should have been looked for in the baby at presentation and ruled out."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This is so painful.. If she went for one hour, did she carry her phone? The description she's giving about how she found the baby, obviously the baby fought to stay alive. Did the dad watch the baby's condition change? Did he try calling the mother to let her know the baby was exhibiting funny signs? 
Haki hii mapenzi ya pesa nane hii! We need to educate our girls. How is just what l don't know. Seriously???????"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This lady's tears,God is counting each one & his day of reckoning is coming. Seems it was premeditated. The reason he weaved himself back into her life is questionable."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,I think maybe because he was taken to the children's right it's like he was not happy or willing to help the baby so he killed the baby so that he cannot be helping the baby

_b6D5wMzKZQ,that doctor telling them the cause of death is uncertain is dumb doctor.the initial findings was asphixia or suffocation that itself is clear that he was been killed by the father.somebody should help the mother get justice.the father should be arrested and be killed with suffocating him also.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"If Kenyans do not all get up and seek justice for this young mother, all of us Africans should rally behind her.

Please Lynn, she needs a lawyer. There was no due process; there are soooo much injustice due to the lack of power.
She should NEVER interact with that murderer EVER! In fact he contact her again, she should immediately report it to the police. He is a major manipulator.
He played for her emotions, he took advantage of her and he should be arrested. 
Find her a lawyer. Maybe there could be a nonprofit organization who can help her. She needs an opportunity to tell her whole story. Maybe that man is  crazy, for sure he is a danger to society.
Mama Kingsley be strong. God is a just God and He is on your side.

Yes, God bless you Lynn. Please be strong. We will pray for you also. You are an amazing person and you carry in your heart all these heart breaking stories.

I have watched this channel several times. I keep coming back because just it touches my heart. As hard and excruciating it is to watch our own brothers, husbands and fathers treating us African women like a dust, or species with no value, I'm so humbled and appreciate what Lynn and her team are doing. They're showing exactly the truth, bad and good about your country. I had/ have been so emotional in many cases listening to our sisters,' young and old stories. I can't imagine their pain. It cripples me and I sometimes swear not to watch again. It's way too much to bear.  Kingsley's mom has touches so many, I want to hug her and never let her go. Thank you Lynn for holding her tightly sooo long. I felt the connection and love. Nothing will replace her son. What a cutie, it breaks my heart. I can't even look at his innocent eyes knowing that his father is to be blamed.  I don't even doubt his involvement to his death. His family at large is cruel and I just wonder how do the parents look their son in the eyes everyday knowing what he's done. Remember that's not love. The day Kingsley died, is the the day they buried their son. He's not human, he doesn't deserve to live. To everyone who has failed Kingsley's mom, the matrons, doctors etc remember karma is ugly and doesn't have messy. You have blood in your hands. How do you sleep knowing what you've done to this lady. I beg someone to let them watch the video. I can go on and never stop writing. This is a masterpiece Lynn as tough for many of us including you. Almost everyone commenting had tears in their eyes while watching.  I saw you too tearing sister. That was good for us all. Lynn I love you so much. I just like everything about you as a person and your show. As of today I'm going to be diligent following. Your work is infectious, and humongous, it makes us human under 1 God. You're truly a blessing.  Kenya is so lucky to have you. You're a treasure to be protected. Your humble demeanor, your simplicity and guts attract many of us to love you every time watching you videos. May you grow beyond your imaginations. I know you are covered by the blood of Jesus no weapon against you, shall prosper. To Kingsley's mom, your tears, heart and pain are ours too. We cried/cry with you till justice is served for Kingsley.  God gave you a precious gift, your son and right now he's your angel. Shining above you. You'll survive and be up again. God doesn't make mistakes. This too is his agenda. Be comforted sister knowing you have a loving Father who's always ready to fight for the voiceless, as you put it. I pray to God, one day you'll come back and be a testimony to what God does and can do when it seems impossible.  I'm touched and I'll be in touch for support. 🙏🙏❤️❤️😭😭"

The matron, the doctors, and the mortuary attendant who are helping to cover up this matter are ACCOMPLICES!!! Remember YOUR SIN WILL FIND YOU!!! You don't want to find and acknowledge your sin, but it will find you, rest assured!! To the grieving mom, I say I may not feel or know how you are feeling now but I will pray for you and for justice to prevail.

This is so painful my advice to mama Kingsley is that God is watching over the Truth will come just be strong
This man will resp what he showed
Just because of avoiding responsibilities you decided to kill an innocent child
You actions shows open the you have something that you did 
If am to be the one to judge you did that without even thinking twice but money buys freedom that's why you are left to go God is the final judge his going to tell us the Truth
For Lynne I real don't know how to thank you may you be blessed
And the mother should be careful if someone is heart less to such  innocent child how about you
However we are praying for you"

What evidence do they need haki…this thing hata God anaona tu who is guilty…in black and white.
Mama Munene may you never suffer anymore."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"There is also a scenario where the child cried too much until he stopped breathing.opening the mouth might be he tried to get breath and on the other hand the father must have completely neglected the child until he died.
Children suffocate and die.
All in all the mother must know what exactly happened that day.its painful to loose your baby just like that.may God give you peace"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I know you feel like all this is your fault, but I want to tell you today, don't blame yourself, it is not your fault. The devil is so cunning and he only comes to kill,steal and destroy but Jesus came so that we may have life and have it in abundance. Hang in there mama Kings, God got you and you'll get the answers. May God cause everyone who was involved in this case and didn't do the right thing, to lack peace in everything they do until they confess to the truth. And to you mamma, I speak the peace of God which is beyond human understanding in Jesus name."

Mama take heart Vengeance is of the Lord, they may humiliate you because you did not have money to pay people to lie but I repeat, vengeance is of the Lord. Be still and know that there is a God in heaven. even a child can conclude that there is no need for evidence to see that this man killed Kingsley. Rest in peace Kingsley-innocent soul gone. so sad...but, the Lord of vengeance is watching. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is Soo sad. God give this lady refuge
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I have watched this interview with a lot of courage. Never came across a story as painful as this one. I cry with you Winfred. I take this case to the #CourtsofHEAVEN. If anyone has been bribed over an innocent child's life; then a they surely must pay. That child was helplessly killed by chocking, probably by strangling or pillow. The child died in AGONY/PAIN and was HELPLESS. One can tell from the open eyes, open mouth and tongue and straight hands. This guy is a moving demon. The first report clearly explains well circumstances of death (he was killed)  and the second one , the doctor played safe by making it vague (probably bribed). I believe soon (the dad) who is the PRIME SUSPECT in this case will be behind bars in JAIL where he belongs.LIFE SENTENCE IS WHAT I PRAY AND WISH HIM now..."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Me too crying with this lady I wish it's those times mob justice shuld have killed this evil guy...is unbearable pain and tough lesson to all of us that if baby is crying in such case of relationships yu should go with baby...may baby king rest well with angels
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"He strangled him with his bare hands, not a pillow. That’s why his tongue was out,  eyes open wide and hands out stretched. An extremely painful way to die. The man is a monster, a devil 😈"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,It's  too painful  may God  give  this  lady  strength and  may justice for  baby  Kingsley be gotten. God I know  you  are faithful.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"His sending King's mother that early to buy meat and he knew the butchery was so far?why could he not have gone to buy the meat himself?  Why did he lie in the hospital that Kingsley had pneumonia?   There is too many points to show that he had a motive.  He had never loved this lady anyway and he never accepted or bonded with that child right from the word go.  He also felt that Kingsley was a hindrance to his life when you look at the pattern of his monthly contributions towards the upkeep of his son.  This guy should be jailed and on death row and nothing else.  He had no intention of leaving Kingsley alive when he visited this child, why did he handle all the paperwork, make the mother carry her dead child- because he knew he had killed the child, why rush the burial?  Goodness, it's very clear that he murdered Kingsley"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May God be with in this journey,it's not easy.justice for baby Kingsley."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May almighty God give u comfort mama Kingsley 😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am pained mama Kingsley. The pain is just too much and the question still remains why Lord.  But one thing i know for sure we will understand it better bye and bye. There is still hope. One day Jesus will come to take us home and the dead in Christ will rise up and we will see them again. Because of this may you find comfort. KJV 1 Corinthians 15:51-55
51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?.

God has not forsaken you. He is with you. When i remember the story of Job i see everything being taken from him ie his riches and children but it was just but for a time. There are so many things that we shall not have answers but a day will come we shall know.

KJV Ecclesiastes 12:14
14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Lastly i wanted to say God is with you in all this. Stay positive. There is still hope.

KJV Ecclesiastes 9:4-6
4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

God is still in control"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The pain is so unbearable...may this mamaa get justice,and may almighty comfort her 🙏🙏🙏
Lynn kindly look for counsellor to assist this lady she is truly hurting."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Money cannot buy peace or be in provision of comfort. Money is the source of all evil. Use of money to intimidate someone is     absolutely wrong. Parents who hold up high on their children even when they have done wrong are not helping their children

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"We can't cry this much and it be for vain.
God in heaven,who hears and answers prayers, kindly,we humble before you,may you make it heavenly possible for Baby Kingsley and his Mum justice be found.
Karambu my namesake,may God's comfort and peace be with you.And for our baby Kingsley,may you continue finding favor before God as you continue fighting for your mum as she is fighting for your justice here on earth.
As for the baby daddy,if you took the life of an innocent creature,who had done no harm to you,may you never find peace in this and the next world.
And as for Lynn Ngugi,be blessed for being a voice to the voiceless.Your reward is in Heaven."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,It's so sad 😭😭😭 if she had known she should have just left with the baby.May the poor baby rest well
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is very painful😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 may God strengthen you may justice be found
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Subhanallah! I wonder humanity imepotelea wapi kwa watu,
LYNN uyo mtu hayuko innocent...
Mtoto amelala amekodoa macho na ulimi nje na uko unmoved kama baba, how??? 
Angefaa astuke...na mtoto kama alikosa hewa caused by something rather than him, eg a showl 
angelia before akufe n the dad angerespond...bt he knows what he did to the kid cause ako unshakable through the whole process ata roho hana...may he never find peace
POLE SANA MUMMY MAY GOD GIVE YOU COMFORT❤️❤️"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I can not even imagine the kind of pain this mother is going through 😭😭I only pray that God sees her through it and may she get justice for that sweet boy. And to any other mother out here who was unfortunate to get a baby with a dead beat,it's better to suffer alone while raising your child alone than to try and get these men to take responsibility. Sometimes the struggle between the two parents only leads to more pain than that of being a single mum. May God give her strength 😭😭"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Aki......me its too much.....this girl has not mourned her baby enough.
Lyn you are an angel....you cry with the crying,laugh with the laughing..GOD BLESS YOU LYN🙏🙏"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"What a satanic man in the name of a father from a demonic kingdom to kill an innocent child he refused from the start. May he and his family members never know peace. May the cry of baby king go with him for ever period. People can be so demonic. Lord have mercy on us.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The father of the child was never prepared to be a dad from the onset. The man hates responsibilities, he hated being called to be accountable for his child. He came to finish what he started and since this lady was far away from the parents, that man found the opportunity to pounce on them. Its unfortunate that the baby died. Justice has to be served. God is watching and He is the great judge that man will surely pay for his sins, that baby's blood has not bled invain.

Mama Kingsley may the peace ✌️ of God which surpasses all human understanding be with you! May justice ⚖️ prevail! To the killer may you never know peace ✌️ let the spirit of this kid make you suffer! Usiwahi lala usingizi hata siku Moja till you confess what you did! Kila siku the spirit of this kid will be crying 😭 in your ears ukitembea anatokea mbele yako! According to the lady she had already accepted to bring up her kid without you!  Why did you come back to cause her pain? Mungu anakuona! Mungu halali neither does he come from your village malipo ni papa hapa!!

_b6D5wMzKZQ,I was thinking the same too.. us women seem bewitched just to ‘belong’ after so long being absent and all the ill treatment he only turns up and the door is wide open to spend the night??? After that he starts to order this poor woman about in her own house for her to go and get meat why couldn’t he get off his backside and go buy it himself I felt so angry this man is evil. Imagine the little boy will forever be crying for his mother in Winnie’s eyes as that’s the last memory of her son alive aaaw aaaw Good Lord save us from this curse of not being strong enough to move away and close the door FIRM where we’re not wanted.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May the good Lord show his greatness in this poor lady’s life in Jesus Mighty Name!!

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Justice for baby Kingsley,,"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I would like to know why he killed that baby, because he had apparently made it clear he was not interested in the pregnancy..and his behaviour after King was born sounds off to me. If he neither wanted Kingsley nor his mother, why did he kill him? Was it to punish her in some way? If so, for what transgression? This is just so sad. I hope the lady can somehow find peace and happiness eventually. But she is in a lot of pain right now."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"As a single mom I know the pain this lady is going through,if a man runs away from his responsibilities it's a red flag he is a bad guy, taking them to children's home changes nothing, I have gone through the process but he was never moved by anything and I decided to leave everything to God, he will never know peace"

People used to run to people they love for comfort and protection, but now, it's become the source of trouble and sadness. It's feels threatening to even fall in love.

In most cases you become comfortable around him and trusts your child with them, ""it's his blood"". But this is the most painful story that have heard of. We all should learn from it.

You will live because God is not done with you.. he's working in ways your naked eyes cannot see... HE'S WORKING FOR YOU AND IN YOU.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Yara dear, my humble prospect on this
: These parts are the essence of the whole show the LN show, connects us to the raw uncut realities of people all over. This way we get to know, see and feel other pples burdens and therefore remember to say a prayer and anything else we can to help  because pple are hurting  out there. This show gives us that opportunity...it's rare."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Good thing my comment wasn't directed to you. In future I recommend Lynn should stop the video and let the person calm down. In this particular case this grieving mom was made left to cry for a prolonged period of time on camera and infront of the whole world!!! Mtu akilia kidogo. We get the message... we see her pain. Letting her cry the way Lynn did for almost the entire video was simply insenstitive on Lynns part. Ati raw and uncut 😳😳 We wacha Bana..We also know it gets the views up! We know how these things work.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,So painful..I cried all through...may the lord comfort this lady... justice prevail for king.

He caused emotional damage to my son by making empty promises to him.I took him to the children's office when my son was 2 and a half years.I wanted him to pay school fees he behaved exactly like this man.He paid school fees for one term when my son joined Kindergarten at 3 years and he disappeared. I was young and naive and I really wanted him to be a Father.Just like what you wanted you are going through the pain my dear sister but God will vindicate you.He didn't have to do this,Kingsley was your joy and peace.Let us intercede in prayer this is very painful you will make it,you will stand tall again.God will vindicate you,God will lift you up.DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF BEING A SINGLE MOTHER.Most deadbeats are monsters!

To me it means nice attempt you want to pin me down with pregnancy right? Showing up ans disappearing at will  was not a good sign. To make sure that there is nothing to link them together he had to kill the child not minding that he is his own blood. That guy must be evil personified.

May God bring forth justice, consolation and strength to move on. That guy and his cohort of a family will get their punishment."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"As a single mom of two, this story breaks my heart, I can't begin to fathom the unbearable pain this mom is going through. Ladies, let's always be attentive to the slightest signs or redflags. It might be a way of God giving you a way out. And also not to blame this grieving mom but when a man denies a kid or neglects his responsibilities as father to his kid/kids, that's a major redflag. That person is a devil, That's a person capable to doing all sorts of harm to the kid and the mom. Some people don't value life. This story is sickening and heartbreaking.
Hugs and prayers to this mom. I pray that she finds comfort in the Lord."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"My sentiments too. So tragic, l pray God's peace upon this lady. There's A God in heaven. He is the silent witness. He is vindicating you Winnie. He is a just God. Oohh Mama we mourn your beloved 👑 sley. Mungu wangu, Mungu wa miungu.. Comfort Winnie. In Jesus Name."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Lyn, I feel the mother’s pain but the legal document states that it is because the two postmortem reports were contradictory hence there was no way they could have put any accusations on him. The biggest problem in Kenya is we are limited with resources and information hence people wallow in their pain hoping for justice but the court has no feelings so they hand you their findings and you deal with it. Thank you for handling this case but she needs to know that most of the world is not fair. I really hope she gets closure with this case because she deserves justice."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Oooho no...am in tears..I pray for justice ...it's very sad
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Dear God, For the sake of Mama Kingsley's peace of mind, may the little boy's blood cry for justice from the soil. This cuts deep"

You have been visited by the devil!! Devils roam freely on this earth and their motive is to destroy! The devil preyed on you, he saw how vulnerable and weak you were, he did not love you! He just knew it would be easy to win you, took your innocence and destroyed you!"

The fact that this man never made any attempt within that 1hr  to help a child he  claims he had pneumonia, not calling the mum with those minutes while she was  away , nor an attempt to take a child to the nearest clinic, telling the mum that the child was sleeping upon her arrival. 
It's just transparent that the killer had finished his mission.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This is so sad a kid just can't die like that and the suspect is just loitering around.. What happened to people who would do their job in the most very satisfying way why would a matron allow this people to do a 2nd postmortem and not tell the lady that she has been given a notice not to release the body? Why would a doctor tell a mother who is mourning that kazi yake amefanya and he has been paid? Seriously what happened to people owning their jobs, being open and offering justice without being influenced?
This man killed this child and this resulted from being taken to child office akaona huyu mamake atamsumbua and the best thing ni kumaliza mtoto mwenye anafanya afuatwe.. May God who sees in darkness, the very able justice Judge vindicate this mother na wenye wamehusika in all this even denying the mother justice may they never know peace na may this young boy sprit never sleep before it haunts its killer"

Surely they will pay dearly and for Kingsley will rest in peace once justice is preserved for him.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,So heartbreaking.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Justice  must  prevail....this is heartless
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Waaaah Lynn Ngugi is truly a woman of substance. This story has touched me to the core & I greatly sympathise with Baby Kingsley’s mum. The pain she’s going through is unbearable. The doctors & matron took the Hippocratic Oath. One  of the promises within that oath is ""first, do no harm"". If Kingsley’s mum is being denied the right to ask questions so that she knows what her son died from in order to seek justice for him,isn’t that an oath being broken right there??? Wasn’t Kingsley a human being who deserves justice??? What is the world coming to???? This is another case of a murderer being allowed to walk Scot free. If Kingsley’s mum cannot get justice from those who should be giving it,I pray that God does not let her tears to be in vain. One way or another,justice must prevail so that the mum may heal & the baby’s soul may rest in peace. Thank you Lynn for highlighting this story & for all that you do.🙏🏾"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God of heaven who knows how this woman is feeling deep inside, may his mother, his dad, the matron, pathologist, the killer and police who were involved in this case to set the man free see and find hell on earth, may their mouths turn to the back, may their stomachs never hold food, waendeshe mfululizo bila break, if they can't humble themselves to hold unto humanity may they stay in the toilets just not to meet human for Life."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Weh I salute the camera man. The pain couldn't allow me continue the coverage.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God of vengeance will win this battle for you mama Kingsley. God of miracle will cause every hidden thing in this situation to be exposed.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"All i can advise young women or ladies is that once a man decide to walk away from the baby, never try to bring him back in your life or the the child. I know it is difficult but don't try to take or report them to child care that will be the reason to kill your child. Learn from me. I was raped at young age but tried so much for him to support it was so stressful, then nikakuwa forced by a police officer for sex and another baby and he was transferred in a flush before i could talk to him, then mtu mwingine tena akanidanganya kunioa but when i got pregnant it was another strong story you can imagine mamake alinitusi my dear i almost commited suicide but i left home ndio nikapona. But my baby was rejected until now . I left my story in the hands of God. I tell you all of them died without even law involved thats how God fights for you. I tell you i have supported my children by casual works and here they're teenagers with good mind n sharp in school. God will fight for you just leave it in God's hand He will handle them properly from the man."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,So sad .. pole sana my schoolmate   ....#Justice_for_king

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Listening to how she described finding the body; tongue hanging out, eyes bulging out and the position of the hands is an indication that some kind of pressure was applied on the neck. This subsequently cuts circulation and increases intercranial pressure which explains the bulging out of the eyes. All said, this Is conclusively consistent with death by strangulation. May the young soul rest in peace!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,You must be a medic. That's exact to the point.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@@ciayobiayo4614. Yes I'm a medic!

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Justice for Kingsley..this is so painful
_b6D5wMzKZQ,You are in my prayers winnie..
_b6D5wMzKZQ,So sad.pole mum.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This story is just similar to that of my sister she lost her son on 2nd August 2022 and the kid was just ok not sick and that day the mother in law had started preparing burial without involving my parents long story short post mortum was done in MTRH and it stated it was sudden death syndrome due to lack of oxygen. We as a family we are still healing but with lots of unanswered questions.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,So sad. May God fight for you
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Oooh!what?poleni sana,,such cases are on increase now days."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This is a tough one Lynn, the pain is unbearable!! Justice for baby Kingsley"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,So so sad...may God give comfort. No one has to bury his/her child. May she find justice for her child
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is too much...what can I  do help jamanii..
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Kenya watu wabaya wanaishi vizuri, wale tunajaribu kuisha straight and clean life nikuumia tu.. Phoo!! God give you and us strength. Haki Mungu kuja tu uone vile wanyonge wanaumia, usitume malaika wako, kuja tu mwenyewe 😭😭💔💔"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Ooh God 😭😭 this is so painful. Who can heal this heart if not you my heavenly father?! May you heal her heart and your will be done in her life. Let her never meet a destiny terminator again in her life. Heavenly father, have your way in her life."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The fact that the dad doesn't feel anything is scary😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"#justiceforbabykingsley The ""man"" was definitely scared of the responsibility of taking care of his own child,(not that the mom herself wouldn't manage on her own) but the fact that it will forever haunt him for being a deadbeat dad. Yaani he stooped so low to the point of killing his child so as he can feel better about himself every night when he sleeps huh? And it seems lack of emotions runs in his family coz one things for sure,such behavior has to have started and nurtured from somewhere and it's so so sad he turned out this way. If you don't want a child use protection or get a vasectomy or better yet abstain. I pray he gets caught and rots in jail before another woman falls victim and like mama Kingsley said,that's the first step to healing. Stay strong mama, God is working His ways!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Uruku my fatherland. May justice find way through your deep and thick tears
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The mighty God I serve see this lady through this I know you going to make a way please lord here her cry.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,May this woman heal! May she find healing! May she have peace. May she find justice. May she smile once again.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,That man should be blacklisted in the all nation he should not be allowed to heartbreak another lady
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God pliz visit this woman
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I have never cried like this! This was murder. With or without a postmortem. He lured her to leave so that he could commit the murder.

Winfred you believe in God, and you know that He's voiceless but with action! Remember the story of Job in the Bible, God knows what the situation is, and this same God will justify this matter(Job 1-5, 13, 17) This same Job believed that God will raise the death(Job 14:13-15,)  Please take courage so to see justice for your son."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The reason y he killed the son is to avoid sending the support he promised
Hii mambo ya kutuma pesa kila mwezi ndio alikuwa anamaliza"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"this one will never know peace. He will never hold a child to call his own: That boy was his generation.He will be very sane to bear all that pain and more. All the pain this girl has gone through, is not a quarter of what he will go through.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Ooh God this lady is beautiful
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is heartbreaking.... Oh noooo....My prayer with you for your healing and justice
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Truly very painful. 
Most probably the baby was crying cause mum left  and since this man had no connection ( was a stranger)to the baby got impatient and in an effort to quiet the baby killed him. Whether his intentions were to kill the baby or not, the baby was defenseless and that's truly sad.
May God give you Justice mama Kingsley🙏"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I agree. I think he got angry when the child kept crying for his mum. Knowing babies, they xan cry even for an hour straight if the want their mum. I think he got angry and tried to force the baby to queiten. If he intended to kill or not , the fact remains that the baby was defenceless and he was murdered in cold blood"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This man wanted a sacrifice.He is devil
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@mike sonko please help
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is the episode I have watched for many hours because of pausing because I have cried all along may God strengthen this lady.justiceforbabykingsley

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Also courts must consider boy child. Because this might be the case of king murder. The  guy might  did this because of child support. Pls judges consider boy child income be you recommended how much he will be paying for child support otherwise such cases will continue. Wacheni kufinyilia boy child. Otherwise pole mami.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"RED FLAGS,  RED FLAGS guys! don't forget to notice them! huyu bwana alikuwa na intention tangu mwanzo na ni plan yake alifanya a long time.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,It's well girl God will fight for you
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Woooiii God help this lady help wipe her tears
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"There is a God in Heaven,  who fights for the voiceless.  He sees and records our tears.....I am been wondering,  why did he send her for meat  that early and not go by himself for it? Of cos I have heard babies die just like that while sleeping, but the baby was awake. Why could he die on that particular moment? ...him saying that the baby is sleeping when she returns bila kushtuka aki ? How could the by who was crying sleep suddenly? Why could he be the one doing the reporting at the receptions yet he barely knows the baby? Him saying the baby had pneumonia?......God knows all this answers and He will act on His own time.
My dear sister be comforted rest assured God will remember you. He will remember you and wipe away every tear.  Consider seeing a professional counselor.  You are still a mum."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,So so painful but let's  say thanks to God bcos she is alive and they slept the  night  together
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Sad indeed.....some baby daddys can be very dangerous and especiali ukiona mliachana na mtu ana anza kujileta back, that is a red flag, sometym coparenting poses so much dangers, there was a tym i allowed baby dadi aende na mtoto ampereke out yani that whole day sikua na amani kabisa 😐 jioni ilifika nikachukua mtoto i felt sooo relieved, and since then mimi hua sipendelei mambo ya kumpatia baby dadi mtoto wangu my insticts hav always told me that man can do anything to my kid, and considering we had issues in court for child support so the guy has machungu, i can only allow that man to see my kid under supervision i wuld not want to lead my kid into a trap in the name of spending time with the dad.....mothers shuld be very very carefull with the baby dadys especiali kama kulikua na mvutano of any kind, lets protect our kids. the atha day a baby dadi stabbed baby mama and akawasha moto kwa gari and he died together the child in the car and now the mother lost mtoto just like that, sad sad indeed."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am puzzled how a father in his right senses can murder his son just to avoid paying child support of 2000ksh. This man Morris belongs behind bars.For making himself a god and deciding when somebody should breathe their last and for ripping Winnie's heart apart 💔 it shall never be well with him in this life.To Winnie,I know that no words can describe your pain, may the Lord give you strength and comfort in this difficult time. I can assure you that everything that happened God saw it and allowed it to happen. He does not sleep, he will surely hold your hand. My condolences 🙏"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Waaaah
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Lynn,  i am very sorry for the loss of the baby Munene. However I  think  mama  munene should not have picked the baby from the scene of  crime(house) to the hospital  the moment her instincts were right that the baby had died because it could have formed a watertight case for the murderer."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May Almighty God heal your heart in Jesus name...the pain is unbearable,for the monster  ...I don't have a word.. justice for baby boy"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am soo sorry mama King, what you are going through is soo painful..I pray upon ur healing..your son is a little Angel watching over you. God will see you through.. Don't stress about work...Kenyans and God will come through for you..JUSTICE FOR BABY KING... I know we shouldn't wish evil upon anyone but may that man have sleepless nights until the day he confesses.. n after that a painful slow death should follow.. If he didn't want to support he should have just left the 2 of you..there are lots of single parents looking after their kids."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Hi Lyn, my take on this story is, that man did not love Winfred from the get go. He took advantage of her vulnerability due to her condition at the time she was walking on crutches. He was not ever for her and the baby complicated things further for him...he is so so evil. Winfreds pain is unbearable, may the lord intervene and give her peace and above all justice."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I read a comment on this page that this man was a community and youth laeder. Maybe that’s how he met Winnie since Winnie was young and needed help. He took advantage of her because she was young and disabled.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,have really cried....i don't know you winnie bt Kingsley didn't deserve that kind of death...i can imagine that situation....may they not have peace forever....damu y uyo mtoto itawasumbua milele

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Soo sad,I have no words"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"According to my small knowledge.... This guy he planned something called perfect murder... Which occurs that no DNA, no fingerprints, no nothing... And seems from day one this guy alipojua atakuwa anasupport mtoto every month... He was not in for it.....he got a chance to create a perfect murder... That why alitumia alot of Time to manipulate this mama so that he can get a chance to do it...(..2.) this guy he had enough time to think about it and plan about it.. From the point mama Kingsley alienda kumchukua town.. He knew from here mpaka kwa nyumba n how many minutes na kutoka kwa nyumba na kurudi n how many minutes... So he come up with a plan and he knew the perfect way n kutokula that night ndio akue na enough time ya ku convince this young mum....he planned every thing that night and he knew obvious mama Kingsley atakataa kuendea nyama coz he didn't eat super,,                 3.that early morning he was estimating from the word go from kwa nyumba to kurudi Tena he will be already done with the murder..                                                 
4.he created his own image so that he will manipulate everyone that he didn't do anything and he was perfect... For more examination it seems that Kingsley died after her mum gets out because this guy he didn't knew the exact time yenye mama Kingsley atarudi and that why he chose to stay and wait for her wafanye kila kitu ndio asikue suspected kwa anything.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Hello LNS family am grateful to God for covering these painful stories and events. But, I beg u please help us with some persons who can just let us understand when to say I better work it alone rather than involving him or her for the sake of self/ child security. For instance u had the story of Edith wairimu her mother had to leave her marriage for only child's life. We have as parents to remember this, no matter how tough it may be where a live is lost in an inhumane manner in most cases we will gang together and justice be served, But life lost is not recovered. Let's just pray that God may pour in our hearts alot of grace to detach from what adds no value though very painful, though still bargain for it;  embrace a better choice against the normal. Lord help parents."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Hata kama justice haitapatikana..anyone who kills an innocent child can never know peace.Karma will deal with him proper . He will see fire. ..he will regret what he did to that baby..na very soon he will follow Kingsley.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Why did he come back that after disowning the child if he's only mission was not to kill that baby..to avoid responsibilities.A man who kills a baby is a demon.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,😭😭😭😭 this is very painful.. Pls lyn this lady needs justice
_b6D5wMzKZQ,He is trying to avoid his responsibility by killing  innocent child   what a fool
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Heavenly Father why would someone inflict such pain to a mother?  Even a little fatherly love this man didn't have. Why would a father be so cruel to kill such a beautiful innocent soul, instead of killing the baby why didn't you just walk away forever, never to come back!  Only God can heal the heart of  this beautiful mum. Such a painful story especially the part she tried breastfeeding the baby. Oh God."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God please show up for this mum, fight for her, may the truth be unearthed for baby Kingsley, and may she find peace in Jesus name."

God will look up to you, protect you, care for you and guide you through all difficult time, I pray that the God we worship to make his own Justice over your Son's death and that guy who killed him will never have peace but instead to struggle with thoughts of your son and to requisition why he did what he did. I ask God to give you strength and peace and Justice to be served and remember your son is in a good place even though he left you too early in a crazy way. ❤❤"

It is another reason l say Kenya yetu tukutu umepasuka pahali with a medical pathologist and a matron  from hell,  your action or lack of action is a total shame to our noble medical profession. May karma meet you both and the murder head on. This is very painful, sad and sickening .  Morris if you intentionally killed this baby,? You are worse than an animal and you belong in the prison for life regurgitating on your actions . Who murders a poor innocent toddler?😭. You were not even in this baby’s life but you found it necessary to kill him😭.  My heart aches for Kingsley ❤️‍🩹 and My thoughts are with mama Kingsley and her dear parents , sending you hugs 🫂.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May our tears not go to waste, Lord hear us🙏🙏"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The suspect is a real killer. No wonder he pretended to love her in crutches just to confuse her. He can only waylay the vulnerable because they’re easy targets. He killed Kingsley just because he didn’t want responsibilities. Shame on him.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"He was maybe planning to kill BOTH

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I just can not believe what i have just seen and heard. A father kills his own son with his bare hands and is allowed to walk free.  In Canada where I live, under these circumstances, the father would have been arrested IMMEDIATELY and there is no  way that he would have been released. The two contradicting autopsies speak to the level of corruption in public affairs. What a travesty!  I hate to agree and even quote the former American president that such countries are "" _______ countries"" Forgive me for this, but I am so upset and infuriated.  Thank you Lynn , for airing this story and I pray that justice will be sought for this family. May Kingley's soul rest in peace and the perpetrator be brought to justice."

There's a punishment for each one of you and believe me you will suffer and die mysterious death for playing dirty on an innocent life.Winnie God will fight your battles and you'll get justice for your son. Lynn I pray for you every day coz I know what you go through when doing such interviews may God strengthen you and keep you safe we love you be blessed both of you 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💚💜💛💙🤗🤗🤗🤗🤭🤭🤭🤭🇰🇪🇱🇷"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This guy had it all planned! He is a dangerous person who killed an innocent child to escape responsibilities.  He should not be in the community he will do the same to another child. It’s so sad the the people who are not financially stable can’t get justice’s are we not all Kenyans 🇰🇪. The matron was paid the doctors were paid and the courts  that is supposed to provide justices for all were bribed too. Let’s fight for justices for voices less.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I feel your pain my dear girl.  May The Lord comfort you. Words cannot express. We stand by you.  The Book of Roman says: The Lord will Reteriate for you. The killer dad will be found by God's grace.

I'm so saddened by all this, I've felt her pain as if it were me experiencing the pain......God will see you through this pain and justice will surely be served....That whole family from the man's side is so strange  coz of how they behaved even someone without feelings couldn't display such.... King's soul is surely at Jesus' feet.....Take heart ❤️❤️❤️....God will come through... Amen"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I couldn't help but she'd tears 😭. Some human beings  can be so evil. In my opinion I feel that man may have felt 2000/- monthly support was too much and only way to stop it was to end the little boy's life. So many questions that need answers and I pray for justice, even if the lil' King is gone, the mum can find healing after knowing exactly what transpired. May God bless you Lyn for giving an ear to anyone."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The last time I cried like this is when I lost my dad, we don't really know what led this man do this but what I know is that when a man denies his own child his running away from responsibilities for reasons best known by him,seeing Winnie feel that pain breaks my heart,am in shock to hear that morris even goes ahead and deny that child even in death over the phone call (may you be denied in heaven too)  The parents of Morris tried by all means to cover this man forgetting they are also parents may the tears of this lady and pain of the innocent child haut that family for the rest of there lives together with there generations  ""butokoro ona thiiri"". 
Below in my opinion is what Winnie needs; 
1. Protection and also her parents 
2.#justiceforbabyKingsley
3.a lawyer
4.a therapist
5.a job after all is settled to begin life again.
6.Friends and family that gives her comfort and love.
7. Finance
8.relocating to a different place.
9. Above all she needs our prayers.
Good luck! May the almighty be with you."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,I have never cried like today😭😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This is very, very painful. That guy had evil intents from the beginning. He saw Winnie on her crutches and thought he could use her. When she became pregnant he didn't want to be shackled with a crippled woman and a child. Then the department of child services came in a forced him to pay child support. He could not do that and opted to remove the child so he could be free from such obligations. Anyone willing to see the truth can see clearly this guy had a motive. He came to execute a well thought out plan that night. Sending her to the market early in the morning was to get her out of the way. Poor baby! May justice prevail for Kingsley and may Winnie find closure and healing."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,You are very right
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Very right! I wish she listened to her instincts.
Baby cried before she left coz Kingsley felt and knew he’s not safe with that beast!
Women! Women! Women! Please don’t trust too quick!! 
Firstly this guy coming at night… yet hamjaongea or kuonana for a while why not come mchana!!!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"@@Chai-mob-fmWhat a horror! What a heartbreaking tale! What a generation! Girls, please wake up. A man who has abandoned you with the  pregnancy and baby, not talking to you, comes at night. Sharing a house and bed with him, how now?? He could even have killed her plus the baby. Stop to be too trusting please. May the LORD comfort this mother."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Too sad,I pray for her,let not ladies trust a man once you have reported him to the children's department,he feels bitter,a wounded lion,never accept him close to you,, remember the nanyuki soldier who killed two kids plus their mother.He cheated them to visit him,took them out for supper,back in the house he had hired a hitman to finish.After that the bodies inside the bodybags were buried some metres away from the house.He was released and last week he was allowed to receive his salary by the court.Justice is from God,from asphyxia, medically it's complicated,it can be caused by chocking, foreign body,etc,pray for Winnie to pick up herself and start her life,one day God will expose the truth."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@@pamelaayieta6071 Postmoterm said no foreign objects found in the little boy. Plain murder.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The first pathologist reports no doubt in cause of death. The second reports uncertainty and only gave a guess. The second holds no water, except to confirm that the man lied about pneumonia. That man was present at the time the child lacked air to breathe. At the very least an investigation is warranted. Common sense tells us this man felt cornered and thought his solution was to kill his own child. God's justice is not man's justice. May God give this mother and her family comfort and peace. He is always in control."

The pain I went through last year was immeasurable. Worse of all, not being able to see my second born since birth. My sons are still alive, but the pain of it is just too much. This lady must be going through a hell of life. What has become of humans? Lord have mercy."

Fast forward,  I pray that the two boys grow into better humans for this world."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Jameni you mean killing the life of a human has became so useless? WHY  DID YOU KILL YOUR OWN SON? To the patents & especially you the mother of the killer, your son is not special more than Kingsley, maybe since you have the money you had him through CS.(depending the situation) Do you have daughters ? don't you think it's a SEED you planted in your grandchildren & their generation? Rich family for how long will you bribe Dr's, Police & the Perthologists?  unfortunately the ladder is broken into pieces for the rich to go to heaven to bribe God. Our GOD is never MOCKED, He saw all what happened to Kingsley and He's a God of justice, your son took advantage of disability of which no one at any given time ask for it, it just happens 
Do you know how many souls are playing, lm not a judge but l don't know if your entire family will ever have peace. Forgiveness is there but forgetting will remain forever. Winnie my dear we will continue praying for you till the judgment hour. We love you Lynn  & pray for you too  be blessed 🙏 ❤"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,The demons in humans more so the father taking the life of his  blood is inhumane.By now that guy should also be in grave attimes I believe in mosaic law

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Yaani kuna mzazi anapata usingizi akijua mtoto wake has caused this much pain, tears and suffering to someone's child and their family?! Some parents though!! If that was my sibling and my parents are supporting him like that, I would disown the entire lineage. I cannot be part of this curse"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,The child was crying for his mama To go with him because he felt insecure and unloved. I wish the mum would have known what was to unfold. Oh God.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,🥺🥺🥺💔
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am disgusted! He most likely strangled that baby. That is a very intimate way of killing because he literally watched Kingsley's face as he snuffed the life out of him and then left his body open (did not cover him) for his mother to find. This tells us he is a psychopath who with no regard or emotion killed his own vulnerable child. He literally can kill any other person : his mother, father, sibling, spouse, disabled persons, the elderly etc THIS MAN IS A DANGER TO SOCIETY. I've searched him on FB, one of his pictures has text saying 'Thanking God for this day' .....the audacity of a child killer! may God avenge you Kingsley and may you find peace Mama King.
I cannot watch this past the introduction, I am already in full blown rage, disgust and sadness. I will do my part to help this trend, for Kingsley, his mum and to keep the rest of us safe. This man needs to be behind bars/ sentenced to death."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am angry,I am sad am crying my eyes out God please why why why her????God please avenge for this woman may the killer never know peace"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,How ignorant was the doctor who advised the bereaved mother to do postmortem without participation of the suspect or his representative. Experience should have taught them that was a legal loophole they were creating for the suspect to use in court.  That was stupid advice!😁
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I blame the government for this, postmortem doesn't need consent from anyone esp for a minor, this is the job of the state to figure out how someone died.
This should be standard procedure once body gets to the morgue, the doctor has to report cause of death and in such cases state doesn't need consent for even autopsy for a minor because parents are the first suspects"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This has broken my heart. Am in pain with her.... Oh my God hear the painful cry of Winnie and heal her wound, help her find justice.Ooh my.....sometimes people wunt understand why one would choose to keep a man off her own blood child. I struggled to justify my action 10 years. I watch this and it rings a bell i protected my son from the unimagined. Any deadbeat, deadbeat for even minutes is nothing good to your child.mmmh..my babydaddy behaved strangely enough. He would steal my child he is with nannys and  am at work, make me leave work to go get him Out of my house.Worst is he was animalitic to visit with another woman in my house. How could i even normalise such a visit ..How could i even trust his women around my child?. I trusted my insticts. I am in pain watching this and having to rem me rushing home to go ensure my son was safe from his own father !  Imagining the an imaginable. 
Women have a instict and if you are happen to read this ...never second guess it/them. Am sooo sorry this happened to you. Am in total pain ! I feel her pain. 10 years and i rem like yest. 10 years and i choose it my way , him out of my sons life. Stand accountable to one day sit my son down and explain to him when he can understand why he had to grow without coparenting. Family will always be hypocritical ! When he called me threatening to kill himself if i did not go back to his life and move back to his house with his son just did it.!  I knew it was time to completely cut him off from my son. I was ready for any consequences. I was just been a mum trying to involve him in my sons life thinking it was best for him.  I think he misconceived that  with wanting finacial support far from it .Sometimes people think you are paranoid. The bond of a mother and child cannot give wrong insticts. I know how this  exactly feels. I just cant even have words to express the pain i feel for this lady. May God please comfort her. How do you heal from someone   ghosting and coming back to kill your / his own child ! How animalitic can a man get ? This is someone abusive even around other ppl..worst is a killer ! How do you gather strength to kill your own child ! An innocent soul.Father Lord.
If you realise your child is not safe with those men baby daddys , give up coparenting, choose your child,  shut the silence around you  what ppl have to say and think,  God will provide for both of you.
My heart is in pain with this Lady..."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This just crossed my mind.. 

If he is innocent as he claims.. Why was he not shocked at first? Why was he not eager to know the cause of death? Why was he not asking questions?.. Rather he was busy rushing through the morgue process and burial...  Let's assume he is innocent, and was only confused that day... Then:

(1) Why did he lie to the police? Why didn't he tell the police the truth that the baby was alseep only to be found dead? That they both didn't know what happened? Why mention pneumonia? And how did he know it was pneumonia that killed the baby in the first place?

(2) How come the police believed him when he mentioned pneumonia? Did they ask for medical records? Can I just walk into a police station and claim that someone died of brain tumor??.. Wont the police ask for anything to back my claims?

(3) When both postmortem reports proved that there was no pneumonia, why wasn't the DPP interested to find out what was behind the father's motive to lie to the police?

(4) If he was truly innocent, why didn't  he demand for the postmoterm before even thinking about burial? Why was he not keen to know what killed a healthy child left under his care? An innocent father would have been itching to know what killed the baby. But he was not interested to know.

(5) If the two expert reports conflicted each other, was it not the duty of the DPP fo find a third opinion from a reputable government expert? Why did he make his decison without resolving the conflict presented by the two experts? A third postmortem report was important before releasing the suspect.... 

(6) If he is truly innocent, his parents would have attended the burial trusting that their son will be vindicated. But their fear, guilt and anger clouded their minds.

(7) His innocense would have been translated into kindness, pain and grief. He would have naturally consoled the mother."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,I agree. They expect you to be okay instead of giving you a shoulder to lean on
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"You are very right.Just as loosing a parent.Like yes,both are different situations, but the worst thing is that people want you to move on like it's nothing.I say until one gets into that situation (pain) that's when they know the pain one feels.And having lost a loved one /your own blood,it changes everything and grief is never given time when to stop.I wish other people would know this."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Single mums please let men who reject their kids from conception dont convince  you that they have changed more so if you have to remind them to help their kids. In most cases they try to get rid of that kid so that you can't  bother them.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"What happened ndo aeke mtoto kwa bed alale,amfunike,na macho na ulimi iko nje,this is thi a mission accomplished? Unakaaje kwa nyumba na mtoto ametoa macho na ulimi njee kwa bed unamfunika ati analala,like this also need to be answered."

Baby king u left so soon rest easy n whoever took part in you demise will never find peace 
💔"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Justice for baby Kingsley some people are so inhumane 😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"There are few empaths in this world. Be it men or women. They have the purest heart, they are loving, humble, polite and kind. The  psychos and narcissist hunt for them  because of their loving nature. They want to have them so that they can mistreat, act cruelly, abuse, use them but not to love them. Their aim is to destroy and kill. And what hurts me the most is when you seek help from their friends and family you will find that  they always protect their evil one.
Winnie is an empath  she needs to heal and understand who she is... Use boundaries to protect herself. In vulnerability she might attract another monster.
She is mourning the son at the same time the person who was supposed to love her and protect them,being unbelievable inhuman.
Looking at the man and the man's family showing no remorse or compassion. Those are evil people.
May God wipe Winnies tears.
 What goes around comes around."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Sijawahi sikia pain hivi...,that man is a monster.,hata hatakiwi kufungwa jela ataenjoy ugali wa bure. Apeanwe kwa mob justice wa deal na yeye once and for all. Hell is empty and the devil is here."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"No words can heal her pain ...God please 🥺🥺🥺🥺may that man NEVER know what peace is...my heart is heavy,I feel heartbroken,I can't imagine the torture thatm king underwent,and the mother bearing that#justiceforbabykingsley"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"What can one say? The pain  is so Tangible, my heart aches for Winnie, I feel such loss and anger. It's bad enough the .....(doesn't deserve the precious title of father) was absent, but had to commit the ultimate sin on an angel. My theory,.. he did not want to pay child support. I mean, the ..... was happy to stay away until he was compelled to pay.
 Our Lord is Good and Just, this person has not got away with it."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Aki sorry mummy. Na people react differently to situations like this. Let us learn to deal with things like this one instantly without second thought suddenly. I feel kuna second thought ya kama, no no noo your first mind had the truth that he fell or  the man suffocated him and all this your husband was responsible. At that moment the one who talk is the one who could bring discloser of what conspired at that 1 hour. Everybody would have known what has happened before its too late."

So sorry mum Kingsley 😢 may God's grace 🙏 be with you and His peace surround you now and always.  Let the image of Kingsley never leave this devil in peace.  Haki hii ni demon on two.  How heartless can some be,  huyu matron is she a mother herself?? How many minutes would it have taken to send a simple message to the grieving young mum? That other pathologist seems was not well versed with what that devil himself had said.  Still results from second one incriminate the devil based on his lies about the cause of death. Mum Kingsley is so sad to loose your sweet angel in the hands of that criminal. I am sure that this is not his first kill, someone who has that kind of guts to kill such a defenceless being tells its not the first time he has done it.  The police could have released a serial killer.  May God's power bring everything to the open 🙏 and God bless and protect you and your family mum  Kingsley from this devil and his family."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,TRUE
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am really angry with the Kenyan judicial system, police service and doctor who took bribes to lie in front of god-what goes around comes around and I hope he lives with guilt that will consume him or kill him. As for this man, his behaviour and traits are of social path, he groomed a young beautiful innocent girl, made her pregnant and denied in front of God and never informed his parents who are also weird. After 9 months, never in the child's life, never supported the mother and comes around at night and sends the mother to the butcher early morning, definitely he is a cannibal, if he did not have motive why not have normal breakfast and go shop for the family and spend time with your child. The mother had maternal instincts, please all mothers do not trust your child with anyone and be assertive, do not allow a man to visit you at night, with his previous behaviour one should have someone incase something happens,.
I am sick and tired every day watching young girls in Kenya being made pregnant, domestic violence and the man keep making this girls pregnant and leaving them to  suffer. Please use family planning, know the man for couple years and until you see their true colours. Do not stay in any form of abuse, either emotional or physical. My heart goes to mother and family and hope they find justice. May God expose this evil man."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Post mortem is not interrogation, the body speaks for itself as all the evidence is right there. The court can still order body exhumed and this will still be evident Asphyxiation is not something you can hide - the neck will still hold evidence. Why do drs put money before humanity; I can’t judge him but let the courts be transparent. Kingsley did not die in vain. May the father never rest until justice is served. #justiceforKingsley"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I have noted how some people here are busy blaming Winnie for going to the children's department, why blame the victim. Kenya is not a jungle, we have a Constitution and we are guided by rule of law. Children have rights too and you don't go killing coz you have been asked to provide support. So many senseless killings and they must stop, they can only stop by us citizens speaking against evil and not supporting it. 
Pole Mama Kingsley you are not to blame for the death of your child."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I agree with you. Winnie and Kingsley are victims. There is only one person to blame and that is the killer. Winnie was fighting for Kingsley’s right to have support from his father. Unfortunately, she didn’t know that’d cost him his life."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,That pig of a man will face death worse than he did to his son.alaniiiiiwe na wazazi wake pia milele...shetani ya mtu
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May that doctor,baby daddy and his parents never have peace until he comes out and confess"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Sure,God is watching"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May the death of the boy and the grieve of the mother haunt them untill justice is served

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"It's like saying her baby was killed because of telling baby daddy to pay child support?right? That man was just wicked
Why put blame on the victim yet all she did was ask for the right her child?
Wouldn't telling women this lead to more child neglect from their fathers or rather make women fear what they legally, morally and even socially demand ?
It's never black and white"

Mungu wa haki atende haki."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"@Lynn Ngugi, Please never force issues in your life.  The mistake she did ,she forced the guy too much to be in her life and kids life. If a guy says he don't need a kid, believe him and treat him as dead and never bother him again. Firstly, she went to the mom of the guy to tell her.....which is a very bold decision especially when the man has not introduced you to his mom, 2ndly, she phoned the dad's guy to ask him why no one is concerned, ....thats so wierd....... 3rdly, she went to children support . This was gross. Please, when you get pregnant and the guy isn't there, please forget he ever existed, pray that God will never make you and your kid go hungry and surely, God will provide for you. The teaching here, please don't force issues, let them flow"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Really! you mean you have taken time to write all this and even edit  without even an ounce of empathy, sometimes when you don't have anything pleasant to say just shut up. 
You know what all that you have written is nonsense, stop condoning evil young lady."

God you are the greatest physician, please heal this heart. Only you can heal father."

Only her(Blessed Virgin Mary), and her alone can understand the kind of pain in this young lady as a mother. Absolutely unbelievable. May our blessed mother take over this case and present it to the strict and just judge her son Jesus Christ. He is the only one who can give Kingsley and her mum justice.... No one else!"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Ninamtuma Kingsley kwa mungu a mwambie amkumbuke mam, oh my God of justice kumbuka mama Kingsley kwa uwezo wako na umjibu kilio chake mungu wa ulimwengu. Any of those who supported to do an justice to mama Kingsley there all in trouble and 8 swear they got to pay bila shaka. Wasi Sahau wao ni wazazi. Malipo ni hapa hapa duniani akhera ni hesabu,utasikia na kuona malipo ukilipiwa mama Kingsley.Lynn I salute you, thank you so much"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"thank God that man didn't killed you both that man is a killer, how I wish the photos of men like him to be pinned here so that other innocent girls don't get trapped again"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I believe that man has some childhood trauma that has brought him up to be a narcissistic person.
Let's treat it as a mental health problem, coz it starts right from his parents the way they've portrayed themselves right from the word go."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I couldn't help but to shed tears as she cried this is sooo painful I felt like there was a wound in my heart,may justice for baby Kingsley be found,I will be in intercessory prayers."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,True lets kip.her in prayer
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I feel the pain mum ....may God grant you peace ...the offender will never find peace at all
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I think its high tym our courts will start serving justice without looking for bribe...any murderer must be jailed for life sentence
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Have never cried like this here😭😭..God in heaven please fight for this lady🙏🙏,grant her peace only you Lord who can...the pain in her heart is too much😭😭😭😭😭"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Heri hata angetoroka na mtoto badala ya kunyonga....lkn Mauti iwe sehemu ya maisha yke,dada Mungu aifariji roho yko."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The true meaning of life is hidden in death. Aki her pain is too conspicuous. Aki she needs a strong counselor. Hugs mama, the last Kingsley's cry to seek your attention before going to buy meat, which was used as a trap, was a big signal from him. The guy was trying to evade the 2k (child support). Aki 2k takes an innocent child like that. Is the guy planning to marry and have kids? Is he haunted wherever he is?"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,He is not.  He is happy no one will ask for his 2k
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God will raise one person who will stand with this mami and justice will prevail in Jesus name.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I'm sorry I can't even finish this video,it's so heartbreaking,"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Can't finish watching the story too painful I hate pain mostly when there is nothing I can do about it.

I can never bring that child back to life no matter what but we can all help her seek justice"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Lynn you are such amazing ,may God protect and watch over you always,to  Winnie may Angel Micheal     fight for you and your son,may Holy spirit comfort and strengthen you,there is  nothing impossible with God, Justice is your portion. To the killer of  Kingsley may  God open your eyes and ears"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"So heartbreaking  so so so so sad... waaah I have cried with you Mama King. Those tears you have shed since King passed, God has seen it all. Justice is coming soon mama. 🙌  God is a God of justice!!!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Let's pool our funds together to get a lawyer to push for King to be exhumed and an independent pathologist to do the job. That prosecutor, the killer's doctor and matron need to go too."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,The pain in her voice  is too much 💔  😭as a mum I feel  her pain
_b6D5wMzKZQ,It’s really sad for her to lose her kid. I really feel her pain .
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"In that 1hour she left the child crying for her with the father, let's try and think like a narcissistic deadbeat father in that period of a time. One, the child probably kept on crying calling the mum after the mum left the house and the more the child cried the more He got provoked, because one, his being forced by the court to support the child that he doesn't want. As a narcissistic person, this people try to remove any obstacle that doesn't free them. By the child's cry and his little effort trying to calm the child and the child doesn't do as he says. He silence the child in the WORST way possible.

Pole sana mama Kingsley, Justice will prevail"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,2k only.   2k ndio unauwa mtoto. Nonsense
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"@kakwasibuzz, oooh yess 2k for a person who doesn't even love you or a narcissist he sees his wasting his money.
I highly suspect this man had a family or was in another relationship and when his other relationship had some downs, he tried running back to try and fix things with mama Kingsley"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,That was really a tough interview.  May God give Mama Kingsley peace and comfort. R.I.P Angel Kingsley
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Thanks Lynn for covering this,I think she needs a councilor.. prayers and justice for the Baby..
But surely this man will never have peace even the family is cursed..watavuna alichopanda"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,This is so painfully .as a mother I feel the pain she is undergoing.#justice for baby Kingsley

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"No child deserves this!!! Who does that to their chil???
JUSTICE ⚖️  FOR BABY ANGEL PRINCE KINGSLEY!!!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"This so painful for a mother. Mothers are life givers, we carry life into our wombs. How can this man do this to this lady, he could just leave them forever for her to struggle alone with her son. My soul weaps😢😢😢😢"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Being a parent of 1 year 5 months old son really hurts deep😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"That's why sometimes I fill to give a fast chance of marriage I fall in mararia😭😭am working hard for my only son, I will wait until God oudain for me"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"No woman should lose her baby like that. But, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could have caused the death of the baby."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"No, SiDs is common in children less than 6 months as they haven't learnt to roll. This.child was.1.year.5.months so not possible"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Impossible  Impossible
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"May the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob fight for you Mama King🙏"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,It's sad how he was hands on kujishughulisha mtoto akiwa amepass na akiwa alive he didn't even care about the baby's existence  . But ma you will receive justice God has already won this battle for you. Recieve your healing
_b6D5wMzKZQ,God remember this young lady 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭it's too painful. Lyn may God bless u🙏🙏

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Alafu Lynn, after Healing, we can do some Contribution for her, aanzishe biashara, asimame tena..."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,If there is a Lawyer who can dedicate themselves to this case ..God will remember your kindness and repay  you with good for assisting this woman.This  is a higher calling sort of case that can define ones career.Honestly that man must be arrested and put behind bars !! How do you come to kill a baby in house where you don't even pay rent.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,May God be with you always
_b6D5wMzKZQ,#Justiceforkingsley 😭😭😭
_b6D5wMzKZQ,He will pay dearly. That's not the right way  to exempt himself from  child support

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I am so sorry Mama Kingsley, May the judicial arm in heaven deliver justice to you through the earthly courts. The minute this man started calling you he had a wicked agenda. How evil can a human being be🙆 Anyone who received bribes or averted justice for king is liable as well. 
Karambu you are strong & beautiful."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I sympathize with this woman because she's very stressed. But, pia that baby daddy could be innocent if  postmortem showed that the kid was not strangled. However, the way he never cared raises questions... Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could also be the cause."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Why did he say the kid died of pneumonia? If he had nothing to do with it, he would be asking what happened to his child not lying about what killed the child"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Mtu akifa ukiwa nayeye utaenda kusema amekufa malaria ama pneumonia nawewe sio Daktari

Sending hugs, love and prayers to this lady. And to you Lynn, may God protect you and your crew all the days of your lives. Shalom.❤️❤️"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,So painful 💔...#justiceforbabykingsley
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Seek the Lord (J e s u s) today while He may be found. Tomorrow might be too late. Think about it, you might live and die at your 120th birthday (Genesis 6:3) at the best but then what? Where do you go? Dont care if you say you dont believe in God and Hell. What if you're wrong? What if the God of the Bible does exist?
You're in big trouble. So.. please (!).. Repent of your sins and trust only in Him. For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation! 2 Corinthians 6:2 Stop loving your idol life so much, you won't repent on your deathbed. You maybe never will have time to repent so do it now. See what's happening in this world? There'll not be peace in this world, never ever, until the Lord J3sus returns.  1 Thessalonians 5:3 'For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape.' Read your b!ble (not the mormons/jehovahs witness') daily. Ask Elohim to reveal Himself to you. Test all spirits (1 John 4:1-6). Pray without ceasing. Everything will come to an end. Dont fear and dont go for the 6/6/6. G0d will provide for you. Choose life, not eternity in Hell. Be aware of the music u listen to. Stop Watch mainstream tv and listen with discernment. Repent of your idolatry. The voices you hear, the thing you see in the mirror are demons, pray for delivrance, go and find a biblical church! Yoga will mess you up. You're inviting d3mons into your life, your home. Your kids will continue to have nightmares and be anxious. Muslims, عيسى ابن مريم is Lord and He'll not come to kill christians, He'll come to judge all who didnt accept Him as Lord and Saviour. Stop fearing your family, they'll know you're a christian so what? If you lose your earthly life, you'll gain eternal life with Elohim. The Christian life isnt about your 'best life now' and 'I deserve good', you're no good! You're a sinner just like I am. Kneel down to Yeshua only. Dont fear, dont worry. Some 'christians' are wolves. Dont focus on speaking in tongues, everyone has their own spiritual gift. Devil worshippers also 'speak' in tongues. If there's none to translate the speaking in tongues, then be quiet! 1 Corinthians 14:19. Wives submit to your husband, husband love your wife as God loves His people. Even if they dont 'deserve' it. Even if they are not born again christians. Be born again if you want to enter G0ds kingdom. Stop watching porn. Stop listening to evil music, stop listening to murder stories, stop contemplating suicide, stop using drugs. stop having s*x outside of mariage, stop masturbating. Stop visualizing and manifesting, stop using cards and sorcery. Galatians 5:19-21. If the christians/pastor you hang out with talk about being wealth and health as gifts for all christians: run, fast! Christian life is not la vie en rose, it is hard! It's to take up your cross and follow Yeshua. It's die to self all day err day (your life lived as a living sacrifice for the Lord). But you'll be rewarded at the end. People will hate you because of your faith. They'll even wanna kill ya. Read Matthew 10: Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Love your enemies, I know it's hard, still do good to them. Dont put your health in danger because of FOMO, many pand emics will come. Fear not --trust in the Lord!Pray for discernment. Stop (sexual) immorality. Teens and kiddos, dont think G-d will not judge you, He will! All people who'll not repent of their sins will burn in hell forever. White lies are lies. Abortion is murder. Dressing up as a woman when you're a man is a sin. Man + man is sin. Hate sin. Love Elohim with all your mind, heart, soul, strength. Glorify Him alone. He loves you that's why he sent his one and only son to die for you so that you would not have to go to hell because of your sins. God is a holy God and hates sin. He'll help you overcome your sins if you just let Him lead you. Seek Chr!stians for fellowship. Read your bible like the living Word of God. Out of the matrix. Love of money if the root to all evil. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Pray always. People will forsake you, family too. Dont mind to much. Love on them. Show love to your ennemies. God may deliver them. Make sure your name is written in the book of life. Eternity is long, endless. U dont want to be burning in Hell. 
'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.' The Lord is knocking on your heart, time is running out, will you answer Him? Tic tac tic tac tic.."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I have never cried this much... Dear God, please intervene.. Please give mama King peace peace and more peace"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"God is not a man!! Mama Kingsley has seen the devil 😭 😭 😭 Yaani, this guy couldn't stay a week before killing the kid?! Huyu alitumwa!! He sacrificed that kid because we can't say he was running from responsibilities, the mom took 100% care of her child. 
Things don't add up kabisa, kwani who are this doctors in Kenya. In other parts of the world you bring a kid to hospital dead with tongue out, eyes open report, you are all detained by police immediately.
Alafu so many cases of people carrying dead bodies from hospitals to morgue this is the states job. Yaani. Once doc pronounces death of a person no one touches that body but doc, nurses then transportation them morgue employees. We need to do better!! A grieving person shouldn't be walking around with death body"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"@Felister Makori, the  services provided in Kenya are beyond comprehension for a low-middle income country. It's very sad."

_b6D5wMzKZQ,You are so right. If they don’t want the mother during pregnancy count your loss as a mother and raise your child for peace. You can introduce them when the child is 18yrs
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I think even at 18 it should be the childrens choice

_b6D5wMzKZQ,I feel so bad for this lady and you will find someone judging single mothers
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"And it's men who judge single mothers, they take pleasure in hurting women."
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I get your point. Single mother's pass through a lot and sometimes they end up single due to circumstances. Who would want to raise a child single surely? People are quick to judge because they have not been in that position
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@DAISY NYAMBURAK sweery it has alot to do with it she was in a relationship with someone who got her pregnant and left her .She raised the child on her own until he   came back and this happened.Its safe to say society will judge her for being a single mother not knowing the circumstances considering this mother did her best for the child's father to be in his life.hope you understand now
_b6D5wMzKZQ,I thought  of it too.  Single mothers have alot to tell
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@@ruthpearl2439 biggest cause of single motherhood is promiscuity among females nothing but of course women detest accountability.We have over 30 methods of contraception plus females have a reproductive cycle why do they still roam around collecting babies from unwilling men

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"I keep saying it is necessary we witness grief to understand it. The burden of pain this woman is carrying is unbearable. What is worse is the fact that she was willing to walk the parenting journey alone, but the other party being who they are decided to show up and rob her of the little hope, faith, and the life of another. How hard can it be to stay away from things you don't want to be a part of? How hard is it?

One disgusting thing about our criminal justice system is the simple fact that they are all about perpetuating more injustice and building a very unfair system. Anytime you find yourself on these corridors, you are reminded brutally that justice is just a name we drop to appear in sync. Zero empathy, fairness, and humanity by the same people who took an oath to protect and serve justice fairly. The only time the system puts effort is when these stories hit headlines or your pockets can do the bidding. aaargh

Finally, when a family to a suspect makes it their business to bury truth, oppress and treat the other parties involved, diminish their pain, and try to exert control over matters they were barely involved in from the onset, they become enablers of injustices, apologists, and accomplices. There is a very thin line between supporting your own and being complacent when it comes to people you are related to. This is how we raise monsters.

_b6D5wMzKZQ,Jamaa ni tribe gan 🥺
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@loise he is a Merian and a youth reader.. Surely some people are evil and a shaming the name of God
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"There so many red flags , he didn’t want the child , secondly when he was taken to child services he didn’t like it so his only way was to kill the child so he doesn’t have to deal with expenses. Why wasn’t he just honest  and say he didn’t want to be bothered and just walk away. Once you see one doesn’t want you walk away . This is so sad"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,listening to the story the guy started calling wanting to be involved in the kids life ...and that when the mum decided waache kuvutania mtoto akaenda children offices ...if I heard it clearly
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Clear motive
_b6D5wMzKZQ,But why don't we hold these ladies accountable? It's clear the man wasn't ready to become a father. Why get pregnant for him? Not saying what he did was right by all means
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@@salomekibiru9191 for him to want to be involved in the kid's life it because he wanted to kill the kid
_b6D5wMzKZQ,@@kinara5365 why do men ask why ladies get pregnant and you have to be both of you to get pregnant. If you don't want a kid usiwange!! Period!

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"He killed the child bcz he did not want to pay child support like Major Mugure killed his children and their mother to avoid child support, sometimes this government enforced child support is not good for the child or the mother. So many women and children have been killed by men bcz of their mums seeking child support. Maybe women need to reconsider bcz the money you are seeking may end up in the mums death or the child or both and the man ends up in jail. Sometimes it is wiser you just struggle to raise your child alone. IJS"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Kenyans justice is a very expensive item to afford especially when we vote leaders who don’t believe in Justice,leaders who themselves have committed so much atrocities,crime and murders.If we voted leaders with integrity and not our tribal leaders then we will not have a messed up society,for now things will get more worse and women will need to be very strong.Wishing every woman and mothers good luck.Good-luck to this lady I pray all goes well and Justice for her baby is achieved"

_b6D5wMzKZQ,"Lyn was waiting to air this story .thank you so much,justice for babyking"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"It amazes me that people can't connect the dots and sense that the world is getting very dark.
Why don't they notice the SUDDEN spike in violence, surveillance, extreme weather, floods, natural disasters? Why don't they understand that cash will soon become digital, in preparation for the Antichrist?
People MUST start to WAKE UP and connect the dots!! 
This was all prophesied in the scriptures.
God is trying to get our attention through these end times events!"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Thanks Lynn for airing her story.i watched her on Kamunjia show was very painful to watch i was one of the people who tagged you.
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"The world is running crazy,we are living in the last days.Jesus Christ is coming back soon"
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Thankyou Lynn for bringing winnie's story 😢 that was a well orchestrated plan to get rid of the son😔i hope justice takes it's course and that fool is charged with murder💔Winnie is still broken😢
_b6D5wMzKZQ,Sasa
_b6D5wMzKZQ,"What does it mean to be ready for Christ's return? 
First and foremost it means to come to faith in Him, to believe in Jesus as one's Saviour and Lord and
receive His forgiveness and gift of Eternal life. No one is ready for Jesus' return who has not received Christ as Saviour.
After salvation, live holy, pray, fast and read the Bible plus share the gospel of God with others.Don't die without Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and end up in the most terrifying place you've ever been to. Satan will tell you Hell is not real! 
 Nothing can ever prepare a person for the shock of Hell!
Matthew 25:46"

IB12MAwLs58,"I have a very similar story. I fully understand the art of delayed gratification. I never shared it with anyone and have decided not to. Friends do not understand when you chose not to do ""fun things"".  Just decided to keep to self. Some things become unexplainable and not understandable."

IB12MAwLs58,Wow
IB12MAwLs58,"Personal finance is something we're never taught in school.. Why??       To understand how to save and stay out of debt..       Yes, hard times will come and you may deplete all your saving but at least you had savings to tide you over during the initial shock of job loss / tragedy and you're able to make better decisions as you take the necessary steps.  The pandemic we're going through now in 2020 ,  has revealed a lot of things in many sectors but the one sector that we all can control is our personal finances.  I'm glad he told his story. I can only imagine the shame his parents felt. Probably being shunned by their former friends and snide comments from others . Sigh.. One good friend is worth everything.   Stay well folks.   🌞"

IB12MAwLs58,"My mum,a single parent  gave up on everything after several businesses attempts failed.

IB12MAwLs58,So sorry honey 😢
IB12MAwLs58,Pole for the lose of your mum
IB12MAwLs58,"Woah, Bien is an amazing orator! POWERFUL"
IB12MAwLs58,"This story of Bien is very similar to mine. except for me and my siblings our parents died and we got reminded at every turn how we are orphans, the disregard, rudeness and being overworked  by relatives, especially even till at a point we lived for years in a children's home although our parents were serial givers and sharing with everyone. It changed my relationship with extended family, and my trust in people being there when I need them. But who is the God we serve he restored us from the dark places and now al 3 of us gírls are thriving people now starting to send Hi how are you doing etc because they probably wanna see what they can receive from us. Am not a bitter person but I needed that concern when we felt abandoned and we were in our early teens not now when am a grown 27year old woman. So sorry not sorry I will give anything I want to give to the 2 family members that tried and other people who am not related to before I even waste my time getting invested in the opportunistic people LOL. God is always in control"

IB12MAwLs58,"@@innocentonganga6075 He's not talking about the neighbourhood, the home they had there."
IB12MAwLs58,"Hey Bien,
Thank you so much for sharing your powerful story. You asked a question in your speech, "" Where was God in all this?"" Believe me I can never understand what you went through because it was hard. I'm here to tell you that God was right there with you. God is good! It is not his will to see people suffer the way we do, there are consequences of living a Godless life. Now your story is one of Grace, grace is at your lowest moment, you had food on the table and a family that loved you and prayed with you, Grace is Gods protection over your life to realise the Gift that He gave you and to be alive to see that gift bearing fruit, Grace is God giving you a musical talent that with your voice you change so many lives, Grace is using what the enemy purposed for your destruction for Good and having a testimony that will encouraged people to push on and never give up. Grace is Gods love for us which is often not perceived because our lens is clouded by worldly things. Grace is all around us when we pay attention. 

God bless you Bien! Continue doing what you do!"
IB12MAwLs58,I relate with this hope one day I'll be out of the trenches
IB12MAwLs58,"Wow. Wow. Wow. God bless your mom, dad, sister, and wife Bien. May you all never lack. Amen."

IB12MAwLs58,Bestyy
IB12MAwLs58,"Oh! My! My life story, our neighbours laughed at us and my Dad’s friends pushed the bank to auction our home quicker. For me I must say I prayed and on a Monday my Dad got a friend to lend him money for the bank while on Wednesday was the auction day for our home. Although Dad lost other property through this friend lending him money, we had prayed for our home to be saved. Today every time I give I remember my parents giving. Bien take that experience as humble experience to know life on the other side.✌🏾"
IB12MAwLs58,"having good support structures i think always helps - through growing up for young kids or in taking risks like a business venture - in spirituality and family values. humility even in expenditure mostly comes from having lost the dignity someone once afforded. it's unfortunate that you have to get there sometimes to understand ground rules, and even that doesn't guarantee it won't happen again - and instead of living in fear of the potential, you have to be hopeful of the outcome, willing to take a chance on strangers and be bold & daring while keeping up your guard... 

the stories of success & failure, thank you Bien-Aimè for sharing"

Your life story is experienced by many children, families and households. The important lesson of it is that some of them had recovered from all difficulties they faced during their childhood period. They became the cornerstones of their communities as you are one of the current best kenyan singer. The life teachs. You were taught to present a better of you. Bravo.

IB12MAwLs58,"I was watching this while very sleepy when  I heard him say Kamura Nkoroi & I was like Whaaaaaaat 😲😲😲😲😲. Then I heard his story & it's like a photocopy of my life but him being the one copying me....cause we actually moved into an unfinished house in Dec 1994 up up on  Kamura Rd in Nkoroi & I also enrolled in Upper in Feb 1995 by then it was a day school, So I used to commute daily & I would meet girraffes along the way at 5.30am cause I had to walk 1.7km to the road from home to the bus stop, near Kunoni primary so that I could beat the deadly langata road jam. Later in 2003 Nkoroi became very unsafe with my dad being shot by thugs but surviving so my folks had to abandon the house until 2018. Anyways..... always been a big fan of Sauti sol cause of the upperhill allumini thingi........but now I am a die hard fan of Bien"

IB12MAwLs58,"Tears of Marriage

 *Part one* 

My wife had been cheating on me for two months now. I discovered it after I got her deleting messages from her phone. This was not her norm. Ever since I started dating her she had never deleted her texts neither did she walk around with her phone. So when I saw the sudden change in behavior, my eyebrows were raised. At first I didn't want to believe it since I loved my wife so much and I never wanted anything to happen between us. This trend continued for sometime to an extent of her not having sex with me. Whenever I touched her in bed, she complained that she was tired or not in the mood. I remember one day, after she reported from work she told me that she was so tired and I should excuse her for the night. Imagine having not played sex for the past three weeks and yet your are married and your wife is still giving you sometime off. The excuse; she is tired.
   That night I decided to confirm my worries, I went to bed early and pretended to sleep. My wife joined me in bed but instead of sleeping, her eyes were glued on her phone with earphones hanging from her ears. She was smiling all the way and I could not understand how a tired wife can stay awake up to midnight? After she slept, I took her phone to check the messages but it was locked. This raised my suspicion more. Why should she lock her messages if there is nothing cooking? I checked her call logs to see if it could give me a clue. Here I found one of her colleagues from work who has been a frequent caller. To my surprise, this man could call my wife more than four times a day. What I didn't understand was why call her when they were usually together in the office? Moreso every Monday, this guy came to my home to pick my wife as they went for the workshop. He was a married man and a leader in a local church. Since it was only call logs with no evidence at hand I opted not to ask her but instead do my own investigation and have concrete evidence so that I don't ruin my marriage just because of being insecure. 
  The following day, my wife left earlier than usual. She had a special assignment to finish up before the deadline. As usual, I didn't touch her though I felt like having sex. It hurt me but there was nothing I could do about it. 
  After she left, I contacted my friend to express my fears to her. She was her colleague and I just wanted to confirm if there was any special assignment my wife undertakes. Since I didn't want to make her realize that my wife had left, I asked her if she had gone to work which she declined telling me that they were having a remote day. This meant that none of them was to report to the office on that day. My wife had lied to me. With my worries confirmed, I decided to play her game, I called Fidelis; Fidelis was the wife to Henry who was my wife's colleague. I told her I want to talk to her husband but she told me he had left. He said he had an appointment with th pastor and since it was a remote working day, he thought it wise to go there in the morning so that he can be home later in the evening before it's late. I tried to join the dots. My wife left and Henry is not at home too. There must be something on, I told myself. Since I knew the pastor's home, I decided to pay him a visit just to confirm what Fidelis had told me. True, I found Henry there talking to the pastor.
  I called my wife to check on her but her phone went unanswered. Twenty minutes later, she called me back telling me that she had left her phone in her handbag and she was in the office. This could not add up since I heard soft music in the background. After this call, I texted Fidelis asking her if we could have a cup of tea later in the day. I needed a feminine figure around me. I had missed that feeling of love from my wife and I needed someone I could talk to and since I was suspecting that Henry was sleeping around with my wife, the best person to talk to was Fidelis. To my surprise, she agreed to meet me without hesitation. But she gave me a condition; we can't meet in the village. It must be away from the village to safeguard our dignity and the prying eyes of the village mongers. Since her husband was not at home, she suggested that we meet that day at Blue waves hotel. Since I had nothing to do in the house, I agreed. 
Two hours later, Fidelis arrived clad in a tightly fitting dress that showed all her feminine features. The dress ended just bow the knees exposing her beautiful legs with her feet in red sandals that matched perfectly with her brown skin. Her cleavage clearly visible. She gave me a sight that I desired in my wife which my wife had taken away from me. ""You are beautiful Fidelis."" I told her as she took her seat opposite to mine. ""Thank you, but I wish my husband could see me as yo see me."" She said pulling down her dress as she sat.

IB12MAwLs58,Beautiful I didn't know he was married but this journey
IB12MAwLs58,'I hate Githeri... ' what an intro'. Very inspiring. I think the current generation if they get lost they will blame no one. If they can't learn anything with such engagement talks they definitely need to rethink about where they are heading.
IB12MAwLs58,"So inspiring, ""brighter days are yet to come"" #AlusaContinua ✊"
IB12MAwLs58,"This is so powerful Bien,"
IB12MAwLs58,"Thanks for this Bien, this has explained alot in my life..I can relate to the fall from grace to grass situation.."
IB12MAwLs58,Stories that open the eyes to our hearts and minds.
IB12MAwLs58,Some of us can resonate with your story. I like the fact you dint give up on yourself. Something all of us should emulate.
IB12MAwLs58,wow!!!!! 💯💯💯
IB12MAwLs58,"Yani, I always thought you were brought up in pure opulence"
IB12MAwLs58,Can sb talk bout his English .....despite it all that rich kid school paid off

IB12MAwLs58,I think the prayers your family made  paid off. A deep raw story...💞
IB12MAwLs58,"Aki, can so relate. 
My father slipped away into depression drank himself into kidney damage and strokes and death. 
Ahsante Bien💕"
IB12MAwLs58,"Your blessings are a result of your dad's kindness. We may not see the blessings of what we do in our time, but in the subsequent generations. In my view health, wellness, and peace from God are the greatest form of wealth.
God bless!"
IB12MAwLs58,"Yes, you don't always receive from those you give.....you actually rarely receive from those you give to. Always anyway"

IB12MAwLs58,Bienaime Alusa Baraza I love you beyond words!😘
IB12MAwLs58,"Alusa  good story man there is this thing though that you may wanna think about deeply, Fate and Destiny things that men have no control over... I can confidently tell you that for you to have such a platform and inspire current and generations to come your family especially your old man had to loose a lot . Imagine if nothing had happened, probably you would never have met Savara and Chimano or even bought a guitar like I used to see you after high school. At times to get to our destinies we sacrifice a lot and experience very painful scenarios. Its always darkest before it dawns"
IB12MAwLs58,"I have listened to chimano,savara and bien ame, you are great men.They are among the few celebrities,whom  l  rarely see showing off cars  etc."
IB12MAwLs58,Blessed.
IB12MAwLs58,Is this the best Engage or I am tripping??
IB12MAwLs58,The depth and realness is just wow! The past doesn't have to define your future in a negative way and what better way than to express it in your music and way you live your life. This is definitely a favorite engage story.
IB12MAwLs58,"Bien, you're not only a musician but a great story teller who chiseled words nicely and put them into powerful form. Please write self help book."
IB12MAwLs58,Lol Bien's funny!  Love it.
IB12MAwLs58,True honest talk. Real struggle but you shook off the dust and stood tall
IB12MAwLs58,"The drive, the talent, the eloquence, the humour, the ability to inspire, I certainly don't regret naming my son Bien."
IB12MAwLs58,Very well articulated story.. Thank you
IB12MAwLs58,Great candid talk n great personalities 🍀
IB12MAwLs58,Wow!👏👏
IB12MAwLs58,Whoa I thought that I'ld come to the comment sections i'ld be like who likes Bien and that's it but I have to admit you got me all wrong and deeply spoke to many people's including myself ignorance.Thanks for the reminder Bien.

IB12MAwLs58,Lesson learned way back: don't always believe what you read on media. Don't!!
IB12MAwLs58,Bien I wondered who was from Ronga  among you .when chimano made the joke
IB12MAwLs58,Damn this is concise. Cest tres Bien!
IB12MAwLs58,Who else liked before watching that is the love we have for bien and sauti sol😍
IB12MAwLs58,Aptly put... Thank you for being vulnerable with us. Totally related!

IB12MAwLs58,Bien should have his you tube channel. Such a refined orator
IB12MAwLs58,My favourite guy in this band ...Bien is a humble and genuine person...God bless you Bien for sharing this 🙏 it's so powerful....sometimes we give and forget to consider if the people we give would step in when we don't have.
IB12MAwLs58,Very inspiring!
IB12MAwLs58,Inspiring.
IB12MAwLs58,This is deep brother
IB12MAwLs58,Wow.
IB12MAwLs58,very informative.Thanks for sharing.Friends and some relatives are overated.You know people better when you hit rock bottom
IB12MAwLs58,"I like the practicality of the talk it makes you think, think about your present actions."
IB12MAwLs58,"This made me continue to respect Bien even more especially as a human. Now I understand your drive, discipline and ability to write relatable songs."
IB12MAwLs58,A story of how your passion can set you free. Delayed gratification. Discernment in people and relationship management. Financial discipline.
IB12MAwLs58,"Awesome 
https://youtu.be/CJrKZJLPfi4"
IB12MAwLs58,To say I relate to this life experience..would be an underestimation. Brighter Days are indeed ahead of our present!
IB12MAwLs58,Thank you for that Bien really inspired me
IB12MAwLs58,I thought former deputy chief justice is Bien’s mum? I always thought he came from money
IB12MAwLs58,His step mom
IB12MAwLs58,Brighter days are yet to come
IB12MAwLs58,"I really enjoyed this serie but with Bien I can relate. My father was a successful barrister and when he faces problems and sickness her own brothers who live in the same neighborhood (in houses he participate to buy) did not came to see him once for 2 years. Years after, he rebuild it all and now they want to come back at home, they want us to be family. It is one the best lesson I received and I am so grateful  I experienced that. For some people, you are important just because they can take advantage of you, your pocket and your generosity."
IB12MAwLs58,"They were coming for help?  So why should they come if they can't get thet help? Painfully, that is the situation."
IB12MAwLs58,👏👏
IB12MAwLs58,POWERFUL🙌🏾
IB12MAwLs58,so no one is going to talk about that classy shoe
IB12MAwLs58,"And as always, there will be that one fool that misses the point every-time."
IB12MAwLs58,Very powerful and relatable
IB12MAwLs58,Epic one Alusa.
IB12MAwLs58,Wow. Such a power ful story.
IB12MAwLs58,Now I see why I always have this perception that u the one who hold the band together they say our experiences sometimes force us to mature way past our age your maturity honestly is portrayed without it being said...and this story is so captivating may God bless you
IB12MAwLs58,Brighter days are yet to come 👏👏👏

IB12MAwLs58,"Amazing,so encouraging"
IB12MAwLs58,"I can totally relate with this story like you will never believe. I also watched my dad give up. Yours was githeri ours was ugali and skuma, to this day i am not a fan of ugali
You are going to be at that point where you need and no one is there to give because i also saw the same with my dad
""Where was God during that time you ask?"" He was orchestrating the Upperhill meet up with Savara and Chimano to lead to Satisol. All things work together for good"

IB12MAwLs58,What does githeri signify(mean)
IB12MAwLs58,Mixture of Maize and beans
IB12MAwLs58,"A meal made up primarily of maize (corn)and beans. Usually easily available and cheap. Eating githeri in this story means just that, because they could not afford anything more expensive than that"

IB12MAwLs58,"@@graciegathua3172 that i do understand, but he makes it sound like food for the poor-and it is not so."

IB12MAwLs58,Had waited for bien sana finally
IB12MAwLs58,Who could have thought that Bien got such a past. But he never allowed it to define his future. A very inspiring story and motivating too. The Dope edition has been the best of Engage talk. Mob lovee💖💖💖💖💖
IB12MAwLs58,👏🏽👏🏽
IB12MAwLs58,"The ending had me shedding a tear😭. But what i love most is how raw he was with the lessons. I wont be in the club surrounded by fake friends. 

The talk was deep but the humour😂😭😭😂😂. Im certain brighter days are yet to come.🤗."
IB12MAwLs58,"Bien is a powerful orator. I was disappointed when it ended. I need more please.
Struggling financially while growing up is something I relate to very well.
Thanks for sharing"
IB12MAwLs58,"i knoooooow, i always love to hear him speak, he is such a good orator but so is Chimano"
IB12MAwLs58,True too nice too short

IB12MAwLs58,"This is so raw, thanks Bien"
IB12MAwLs58,Yours is a tale of grace to grass to grace again
IB12MAwLs58,True that.
IB12MAwLs58,@@Achebi but it's the nature of life sometimes
IB12MAwLs58,"This is deep,I have learned humans will love you for your position and can't stand you as a person ,am learning to watch who I get to sit with on my table,strong Bien"
IB12MAwLs58,"I hate Githeri.

IB12MAwLs58,😂😂😂😋😂😂ilove it

IB12MAwLs58,This guy .......🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IB12MAwLs58,"Raw, powerful, and honest. One of the best Engage talks."
IB12MAwLs58,"One thing I like about the guy, he appears mature - most Kenyan musicians never mature upstairs!"
IB12MAwLs58,N
IB12MAwLs58,"Bien you are an amazing talent in the 254🇰🇪
This was so real and felt sad and questioned myself to some point
Appreciating your family is vital
Real friends are a positive energy to one's life 
Real friendships should be symbiotic not parasitic 
Saving culture is important 
Brighter days are yet to come"

QzIkndzWYU4,Love must be sincere. Is love about condoning sin and throwing caution to the wind. Dear Diana have some self respect and stand for yourself. You owe yourself assertiveness and decisiveness. HIV is not a respector personality.

You tear people down beyond repair..you leave everyone down trodden and you have no mercy, looking for a million subscribers...its as wicked as the evils done by your culprits...even if I would have an issue,  you won't be my choice...I hate the way you hundle men, destroying their ego. Those behaviours in the hands of a caring person not greedy for subscribers can be solved amicably...YOU ARE EQUALLY GUILTY"
QzIkndzWYU4,"Angel, at the end of the show you say giving up should not be an option.In my language, it is said that a pot that has been used to cook fish regularly, will always smell fish. Some women have not given up on their marriages but have ended up dying of  HIV/AIDS.Is that fair really?Let's think about this."
QzIkndzWYU4,You are right to some extent
QzIkndzWYU4,I hate this man

QzIkndzWYU4,The worst part is when a marriage is built on hypocrisy.   Most likely  such kind of marriage ends ugly and because of mistrust.  Sorry for Diana but l hope the guy is screwed right now by this situation.  Hope Diana would understand and try  to heal.  Hii ni ngumu though juu the husband say wife huwa tired so he goes out to get managed by side chick.  Me  l think l would see him as a different person hencewith. Somebody who values only the money and the position  l have.  Diana huyu mtu sio genuine he doesnt love you he loves your money.  Let husband prove he is genuine in his marriage.

How I wished the man realized earlier that he had a gem in her....such a great investment. Trust takes long to build but only seconds to break. It will take long for him to rebuild the trust and he has to be willing to walk and trust the process.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Good morning team Lynn Ngugi Network,
What are your views on today's story? Do you support polygamy and do you believe one person can love two people at the same time?
You can check out the Abrahams YouTube channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzs3YK69EtLbLLi9cwUFJLA/featured
To share your story with us, send an email to lynnngugi4@gmail.com for consideration.
Thank you so much for watching:)
See you on our next video"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Jesus said husband should have one wife.. You're promoting evil,calling evil good."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Noooooooooo to this. It’s not valid
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No u cant love 2ppl at the same time,he is lying to one..naona sarah ndiye anadanganywa.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cannot support polygamy ata kama nowadays it's the oder of the day
q4sWUJxjc4g,All I can think of is how the Sister Wives in the US are now. Two have divorced him...he stopped loving two of them. A big mess.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Relate😂😂😂encouraging the guy for nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mmmh, people mad at Abraham as if their men aren't hiding 50 mistresses somewhere,,cera is wise not to loose his man just because he has decided to love openly, yet he would have chosen to keep both secretly.. this is the way for someone lustly but not under the same roof, atleast establish a home for each. Boundaries is what they need. There is a difference btn leaving someone for somebody and keeping the lov as you mingle. My thought though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This makes me  remember how i grew up.  In polygamous family, one of the woman has to lie low like an envelope, pretend to fit in, accomadate rejection abnormally and on top of that raise children who keep wondering true love exist among themselves as step siblings.
That comes from both women' "" Abraham ni mtu hawezi wacha watototo wake""
Yaani its about Abraham and the babies and not the women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Will they be preparing the children to face the world?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These are 2 grenades,a missile and explosive in the house!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is so stupid, he is not even embarrassed"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I rather die single than being a secong co wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is not okay, may God help Sera from this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What happened to the empire
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah may God's peace and genuine love finds you coz betrayal it's really baaaad!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Witchcraft is real. This dude is using some heavy stuff on them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We get what we deserve.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just a matter of time, this madness will come to an end.

Remember Sarah and Hagar."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very selfish man, only thinking of himself and his lusts. If his wife would bring another man he would complain."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't sit for such kind of interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nonesense,i cant take this!."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where is this empire now????
q4sWUJxjc4g,Guys 😢😢where is Serah now??
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah l dont think your happy but you have no option if you had achoice you would refuse.Pray to God its not too late.Sorry to be rude but moreen pray to God to give you your own man.Heaven is real hell is real, Jesus is real and satan is aliar."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa pic ndio atuoni ya Abraham and cera alone
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wako same age hadi I love them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow after listening wako sawa imagine
q4sWUJxjc4g,But wako sawa anyway all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you just the best the questions you ask and very sensitive in a wise way I love you girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really feel sorry for Sarah and do you really love her Sarah pls open your eyes my sister
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mr Has sweet voice
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man stupidly thinks its Moureen with a good heart which brought them together. He doesn't know it all starts with the first wife. Imagine Cera fought her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuwee! i have zero energy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very sad story 😮😮😮😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Old Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Ngugi you are an awesome interviewer. You asked very good pertinent questions
q4sWUJxjc4g,Clearly Maureen played her cards. She was strategic. Extending his deadlines and delivering a lot more supplies for him. Abraham is a classic opportunist. He said the relationship was symbiotic. It made sense for both and took her up as a form of gratitude for her support towards his business. This interview is sickening but we listen and not judge
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This situation of we came together to build a family is wrong. Did Sera ask for help? Everything is about how Maureen has been helpful etc. and the guy says he is attracted to light skinned women and those wearing heels. 😅The ladies are in tuckies now. Definitely he will see another lighter skinned lady with heels. 

Abraham cheated, moreen wanted him and they normalized it. The worst situation is inviting her to stay with them so he doesn't have to pay rent, upkeep, bills and everything else in another home. 

Abraham is a manipulator and opportunist. Sera is genuinely in love and she accepted the arrangement because she can't see her self else where with 3 kids. Sera is beautiful and calm and they have built a beautiful  life together over 8 yrs. We wish you them happiness though truth be told, God made marriage for a single man and woman and He intentionally made women to have a jealousy and protective nature for those they love. It's really difficult for a woman to live in such a situation even if moreen was her real sis. So saying that they love each other as sisters and as friends etc, is a facade. They know the truth in their hearts."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That kind of life stile,,,, its only for miracle winners, like sarah and ABRAHAM, PEOPLE OF GREAT honour."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pity those Beauties who sit wait g for one man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ibrahi mo dear this is not aGod thing it's Man made don't deceive yourself and other s
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is here 2025? Are they still together?😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,This was cultism
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is selfish. He wanted to have the best of both worlds. He knew he was wrong that’s why he was keeping secrets. He took advantage of Serah’s meek spirit. Maureen is trying to justify her wrong and rid herself of guilt by trying to befriend Serah. It’s very sad. 😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is soo young compared to Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Serah would be much happier if everyone stops telling her how she's supposed to feel.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen ati its not bad being a second wife!!!!!get out and trust God for your own
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't know what to say but its very hesrt breaking, they may behave like they are enjoying it but trust me Cerah is hurting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is wounded
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He will marry again, this time another beautiful woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love this, as a man I feel Abraham has broken the barrier of hypocrisy. It's better to have both of them together than hiding and causing chaos later"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So this man cheated and told Cera to decide whether she was going to stay or leave😂 (audacity wewe) also Maureen never feels like she's not getting the guys attention but Cera has to remind him sometimes that amemtupa 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii shida yote ililetwa nahuyu fisi ya  mwanaume ...i pitty serah my God rem her😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walienda wapi bydha
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn....your stuffs are always unique and awesome. For Abraham's family, they are a special and unique couple. I see a blessing in their unique than blame anyone. Not sure if it's Godly but the good things is they are all happy and none has suffered."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Keep the fire  burning  glory God
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen u should look for own husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen looks too pld than serah for Abraham,ama alikua amekosa bwana akanyemelea abraham"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah isn't okey ...her eyes says alot she loved this man alot she feels betrayed...saaad😢inauma
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wanarembesha umalaya..shaitani ashdwe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"PATHETIC.....JUST PATHETIC 😂


I need an update and I hope Cera has left, she deserves pure and genuine love. 

Men can be disgusting fr...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😂😂😂women,,hamjipendi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polyandry too
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cannot cope,I would revenge with anyman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@LynnNgugi. Two years are over, we need an update"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Here in maasai land someone can marry upto seven wifes....i wonder if you take then to the interview and start inquiring how they got feeling's 😂😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are they still together
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sorry for Sarah. This can’t be a genuine relationship no matter what they say. When l look at Sarah’s face l see pain and l see  pretense am a woman and no woman can live this way and deep down say they are happy. This is so sad this man is a NARCISSIST in all aspects of the word 😡😡😡.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham..enyewe majina yana nguvu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kano akadajja kajoozi bulala

Ladies

Invest in yourselves so that when a man decides to damp you 
He kisses the door"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm rewatching this in june 2025,Lynn kindly, could we have a follow up if possible"
q4sWUJxjc4g,watching in JUne 2025 pia
q4sWUJxjc4g,Watching on July 7 follow up pliz
q4sWUJxjc4g,Anyone with current updates on this story? It was so painful to watch Serah 2 yrs ago tolerating this nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man has no respect for women arrrggg😢😢and Serah is stuck in this relationship 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,They're very happy..And Abraham is so respectful to them..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Preachers  what does the word of God  talk about this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😂😂😂Weeh Kuna awa na tena Kuna mimi napatana na video kama hii, woi, serah skona nguvu aki, mimi nliachia Maureen kila kitu nikaenda mpaka watoto akae nao ju sasa alitaka kukaa kwangu na bwanangu, now it's been three yrs since I left 😊😊 aki ndoa inataka neema ndo ufike hii level 😅😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cried when Cerah gave the parting shot.... but she really needs to raise her self esteem
q4sWUJxjc4g,very selfish man ..Cerah is a gem I wish her all the best😢😢😢😢she is doing all this to make Abraham happy and the kids...but the guy does what he wants without considering her feelings
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Sarah that's hilarious
q4sWUJxjc4g,They resemble each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,There way they laughed at serah when she explaining how she started feeling alone....ooh my God...
q4sWUJxjc4g,A very happy family
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are in last days really people glorifying&enjoying Sin😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you are a strong woman 
Stand still and you will see the salvation of God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wishing them well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Habraham is selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,2025 are they still together or one left
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can never do this, unless my head is seriously sick"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think there's a lot in this😢
Mimi nigejitoa immediately"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hawa waliwachana
q4sWUJxjc4g,You should be careful when name giving your babies imagine calling your son Abraham samsom weuh I hate polygamy
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is father Abraham what else did you expect 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not romantic at all. Cera hates this  man too much that she can't give them freedom to be each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,"9:02
I can't watch beyond dis point.
Irritating"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the way this man looks at moureen, she loves moureen not cera, cera you are Soo beautiful and God will come through for you one day,this whole story is a lie"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Being extremely kund is not good, Cera could have invited her problems & hence depression"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And trust me there's another woman In his life hmm, the other thing there's alot of pretence in this family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I’ve seen women in polygyny who are thriving — loved, respected, emotionally supported, and financially empowered. Meanwhile, I’ve seen women in monogamous marriages who are ignored, cheated on, overburdened, or emotionally starved. Happiness isn’t tied to a structure — it’s tied to the quality of the people involved. Let’s stop pretending one model automatically guarantees liberation or oppression. That’s not feminist. That’s just intellectually dishonest"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May i never listen to a such story again😢,i feel for Serah...one day....God will come through for you.The word of God will never change to suit and favour our desires,anayeingililia ndoa ni kifo"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah, you are a strong woman. you have gone through a lot and that is why you are able to tolerate Abraham's decision. He said it very well, they were things you seemed not to agree with that why he started finding out Maureen. Abraham is a narcissist. Serah, psychologist and doctor research found that, once hold up stress for long it turns out to depression and depression bring psychological problems/Mental health issues. Mental health issues have different symptoms and signs; they range from headaches, face smiles, and change of characters. to cut the story shot, go to a psychologist without their consent, make it private and get advice and you will thank me later. You are afraid of what will the society say about me? don't mind what they will say about you, you are not the first one nor the last one. You also want to prove to your Dad that you can't disappoint him even if you got married. Stop worrying a bout others worry about your peace, your health and self love. I Love you Serah. Maureen in most her conversation was not able to explain herself because she is not truthful, she can't remember even how it happened because she is guilt even from the word go...............finally Serah find yourself you long way to go in the this world."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God only gave one rib for your wife , not two ribs so Sarah is your wife,  damaries  is not yours give her room to find her husband , you can t afford to  marry two , you need Jesus to save you.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's so much bullshit in the comments people are sharing here. Women are walking away from great men and becoming prostitutes just because the man loves another woman in the nameof empowerment, and now you are thinking Cerah was stupid? Nkt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God save me from such arrangements...I would rather be alone.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am very keen on love topic but to these level no
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This the most weird story I have watched  surely you man you are not fair 
To your first wife  and was so hurt when that second wife failed even to apologize  to her 
And you are just expecting respect from her instead of you promoting to respect her bse you  came to her marriage 
May God touch your heart to change, you go ahead teaching people to go and spoil people's marriages that a not Christian please repent"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""dont throw stones""meaning you dont want to be told the truth"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love this,Serah n Moureen it's my prayer you continue the love win to make your husband strong,I admire this family,God bless this family 
I love you all❤❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,May this kind of stupidity never locate my husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,😢I thought serah was the second wifey coz she's very beautiful than Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We are in the end times 
Isaiah 4:1"
q4sWUJxjc4g,get born again
q4sWUJxjc4g,sera is almost bursting
q4sWUJxjc4g,Be careful with men with Dimples Meen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is a Good woman may she be strong 💪🏼 in Jesus Name 
Men are so hurting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sometimes a mans soulmate is another man😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣women stop enabling emotional abusers😂😂😂this man is clearly selfish with the way he says ""If you want to go ,go but leave my kids ""..He loves Maureen but is with serah because of pity..i hope serah finds the strengtg to leave""😢"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is so disgusting!!! And by the time one airs this out, I’m just wondering what you’re teaching  the young girls!!! Is the motive to tell girls/women that they should stoop this low😡😡😡. There’s no happiness here, it’s all pretense!! From the title itself I felt like this isn’t something I even should feed my brain with🤬🤬"
q4sWUJxjc4g,the second wife looks older than the first one.anyway .. let me mind My own business.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moreen u have a child with that man but let it stop at that, mive out and let God give u your own man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is so beautiful, I feel bad that she was hurt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I like how you ask the questions ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you are selfish.
You will soon marry a third lady you selfish guy. This is nonsense sin."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ladies let's normalize self love coz no sane woman would tolerate this BS ,, invest in yourselves so that you can walk away in such situations 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ladies learn.  Polygamy is a beautiful thing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You can't love two people in the same way. Maureen you stayed single without being dated another man before this man. Am confused with you Maureen, please don't encourage anothers to be second wives. God doesn't allow this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lies!Lies!!! there is no one that can serve two masters at the same time,,from the look on their faces, Abraham loves Maureen more than Serah ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story sounds like a horror movie. Seriously!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is Cera okay? I just hope that she's not boiling inside waiting for her explosion one day.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeeee. Living in the same house??? That's ABIT weird.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is hurt so much,I can see the pain deep down.she is humble and she don't want quarrels she just accept it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is there anything wrong by being a second wife?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your language is very interesting but for those who don't understand your language it does not help with those who don't understand your language.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is a natural African woman who probably used to polygamy. 
Her acceptance of Maureen made ut possible.  Africans are traditionally open to polyandry."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God this is the worst night mare for any 1st wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where did this family go
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where did they go to?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If there were many of this type of Abraham, Sarah and Maureen of our world today, the grieve, bitterness, broken homes, disruptive child upbringing, and you name them, won't have been so devastating to such a record level today. 

Peace, respect, love, and understanding transcend all..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"While recognizing one Christian perspective of one man and one wife, the fact is that our world had evolved so much and the need for further reasoning and desire to finding practical and contextualize solutions to the problems and issues of life in its true sense, cannot be overemphasized, especially if we truly want to have a better society today...

There will always be that moment of a choice between ""evil"" and ""lesser evil"".

We can't change what has happened but to rather find ways of making the best out of the outcomes..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a story for us African, typical of our traditions, values and cultures....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very insightful and mind-blowing! Thanks to Sarah, Maureen and Abraham for sharing their unique stories. Your courage, respect, understanding, support and friendship speak volume. LNS, you are doing amazing things and impacting your audience positively. The time spent was worth the knowledge and insights gained...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hay Lynn ❤❤ do you know that you look more beautiful in this hot pink kadress❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My goodness! Have you observed,on lynn asking the last question,( of is there anything you guys feel we have left out you would like to air out?) how the two women put their hands together in-between their thies crossed in the same way!!!!  More so both looking at their happy husband! Indeed, there is kind natural love in this family. ❤ Too unbelievable yet true. Blessed stay ladies, love each other kindly, for you will never regret love out of kindness, understanding and love itself. Blessings in your marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oooh lynn, I have loved your inquisitiveness and particularity on questions asked, likewise your intrusions were apt to making the story progress on well for the audience's apt consumption."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jolene never listened to the part where dolly says'you could have any other man but I could never love again'
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's no happiness in all this it's all pretence this man is not fair at all

q4sWUJxjc4g,I rebuke that kind of love...may this kind of love never locate me even in my dream
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If I had 2 wives I think only one would matter. Women should always pride themselves. If a man brings you a second wife, it's time to go!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let's stop pretending!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen and Abraham shenzi nyinyi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women STAND UP!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Try having another man you'll know just how oppressed you are
q4sWUJxjc4g,As long as they are happy stating together  there is no problem and what I like  is  they help one another  and both of them are married  there is no sin and the man must live them the same way and it's better they are married .married is better than to be a prostitute .And they are all building the house not to destroy  keep it up  brother  because  women are  a lot than  man. .😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't survive in such an environment

q4sWUJxjc4g,Kwani ni twins but siwezi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is not real... It is fake and hurting Sara from inside. How can anyone say this God doing?. No,no.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I totally don't support polygamy but we see people in polygamy so polygamy is a choice but against GOD'S word.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, please, if possible, stop bringing us such."
q4sWUJxjc4g,How are they now😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If it was in south   I could  have  thought that 3 some,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cannot.. I can't. I will never.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God have mercy... This is not God's original plan for marriage... We are just living by God's mercies... Wooiii it's not a laughing matter... Nothing to be proud of... It's wrong... May God help our generation...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen looks abit older than Abraham and Sarah, may fhis marriage locate my enemies"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lamech, a descendant of Cain, who took two wives, Adah and Zillah, as recorded in Genesis 4:19"

q4sWUJxjc4g,NOT LYNN ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,So great. More. Men and Women to keep this harmony
q4sWUJxjc4g,😮Now this is very clear that Cera's battles is in God's hands  ...She is just doing the Lord's work especially becos she got aware that Moreen was here to stay... for that she was physically defeated but Spiritually uplifted ... The husband or wife is approved to leave the marriage only if either of them cheats... Abraham has defiled the Cera's white clothe ....from the way Moreen is comfortably with the peace drained from Cera i cud bet that she didn't even apologies for squeezing herslf in between what is was bound in heaven and earth ...at the end of the Day Cera secret tears have not dried...The Love  Cera have for his husband and the Covernant made ..she understood the task In the Spirit even when she didnt boldly see it in the physical ....at some point the smiles from Cera is the LORD's  Work.....There is no beauty and nothing to be proud of in cheating ...if there is any to be grateful for... match make in hearven Wow no one knows ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks likes she is forcing things..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish to be this guy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are these people still happily married?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No.

Dear Lord, never send such a man my way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,See before there was no prostitution but today see fragaments in africa culture all girl are on the streets slaying looking for survival but when a women can work no problem to be with two women or three so long as they can deliver that possible and people check on yo hands fingers one thumb is a man the rest of the fingers are women not same
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is african culture people are surprised becouse of mental slavery of religion prison poverty caz women is wealth but because cohesians are poor they injected their poverty in africans through religion but are fore ancestal were rich with their lives but today people are fighting killing are ather so people wake up africa should go back to the drawing board to rise again as black people
q4sWUJxjc4g,You guy you gonna loose everything in life. Those when are not in love but plotting your down fall..not all of them are genuine...the second lady puting a damaged trouser came in your life to destroy you just give it time.the reward is on the way

q4sWUJxjc4g,"The first women understands better than the guy and the second wife, God bless you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am only interested in what forced him to get married to a second wife, many questions there unless they agreed both to???"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shameless Maureen.  God will  judge you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why should someone be offended by two women marrying one man when these people are happy ??? Its their choice  and they are very happy and in many cultures and religion polygamy is a normal thing . Therefore as long as these pple are happy i find it ok
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not good to be a second wife at all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is beautiful and strategic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Destroyer
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wounder why pple rush in judging this family where a man genuinely come out and say this are my two wives i  love them, but they are happy of being told they ar alone with agangs of side chicks around them and some even knows it and choose to stay"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But why you people ""viewers"" mnasema vitu zingine ai...you think wataachana??? No they have decided to put it public awaweziiii"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is very normal, our forefathers married more than 2 wives and they lived very well, The fact is the whites lied to us to have only one wife, Who said or where is it written that more than 2 wives is wrong??? African let's stop following the Western lifestyles let's be true to ourselves and lead our lives as Africans. Tabia za kizungu tuwachie wazungu kabisaa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just look at Ceras face heartbroken realy soory dea ur such a beautifull lady u dont deserve this man for real
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maurèen is a home breaker
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham anasema its a blessing in disguise all wrong & fake lyf
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a fake life no african woman can accept this kind of mariage fake fake
q4sWUJxjc4g,My gud pple of kenya just look at fantasy life.look at ceras eyes she is forcing herself to talk its lyk amèlazimushwa kuongea na Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah u are beautiful inside out. The man is selfish to u. I'm so sorry
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah and Maureen, I speak to you both with love and wisdom—please understand that you are being used.

God’s design for marriage is clear: “A man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). He did not make a mistake. If He intended for a man to be with two women, He would have said so.

By allowing this situation, you are giving Abraham the power to manipulate your emotions and build his ego. Ladies, let us love and respect ourselves. You are worth more than being a mere option or a second choice. God’s design for marriage is one man and one woman—not polygamy.

Abraham, you have caused Serah deep pain, and she does not deserve this. She has stood by you from the beginning, through struggles and sacrifices. The Bible commands, “Rejoice in the wife of your youth” (Proverbs 5:18). Love, honor, and cherish her as God intended.

May each of you find the strength to choose love, respect, and obedience to God’s will."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support this at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is corn man 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you skeemed your way into this marriage! No matte how much you try to laugh it off... you're a home wrecker, and Abraham -Cera deserves better. She is a gem. @Cera, more Grace for you. Please ensure you see a therapist,this is too much to handle. These two people DO NOT care about you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wakisarnitize izo simu,😢😢😢😢wacha ninyamaze cna loya"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah must have gone through alot. Hugs to you mom. The hubby and Maureen did an evil thing of cheating on her. A kid was not justifiable to marry Maureen. Abraham could have as well taken care of the kid without marrying Maureen. They may look 'happy' but deep down....this was very wicked. Sarah doesn't look happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If am serah I can pray dangerous prayers, they can know I save a living God who said he who finds a wife finds a good thing and he shall receive favor from God  Did not say he who finds wives. Just wait it will not end well."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't trust him, see his eyes. I hate men who disappoint the wife. Snake, there is nothing good about him, just wait he will marry another one."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is shameful.Hopeless and disgusting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Another wife loading,u cant gather every good woman to urself 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God please don't let any other woman go through this pain🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah and Hagar
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really love the first wife. She really supported his husband. I like Maurine because of coming as a partner not a destroyer. I come from a polygamous community and that is exactly what i would have done the same for the sake of the man i love. Human is to error but he never denied or chased the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,walienda wapi hawa...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hmmmm this man is young .....but Mourine is older than both cera and husband and she's pretending
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hmmm this man is just fisi am sure he's seeing another lady ...I bet Mourne is a pretender...  Sera has pure heart but again she's not happy to be with co wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter how shiny this looks. It's a sin and if the three people are to die they will end up in hell!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It wont work especially that they are living together!! @ some point jealousy will creep in but anyway we listen and we dnt judge 🤞
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God  Forbid,I can't entertain this nonsense..Kama  mbaya mbaya🎉🎉.. .Ladies  we should  respect our selves  ,,.Kama  Marriage ni hii wacha ikae.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men are naturally polygamas.Abraham has has just made his case public.
q4sWUJxjc4g,At some point Sarah in the bible allowed Abraham to marry a strange woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham in the bible and Sarah case
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nataka Serah wangu oooh  God do something soon
q4sWUJxjc4g,its 2 yrs now lynn tuletee awa tena seems like the tables turned
q4sWUJxjc4g,mzoea tamu huhalalisha haramu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People normally quote the Bible very wrong to satisfy themselves. Sin is sin, and to do wrong is wrong...we should accept our mistakes. He said Christians read and choose some verses and don't read the whole Bible. Let me say this by asking him, do you do exactly the same level as David, Jacob, Ibrahim, Isaac, Solomon, and other prophets did to build God's altar everywhere to the extent God had to manifest his power to his people, or are you just quoting prophets who did this as well we can do it?. Have you ever met an angel or been visited by one, even in a dream?

Guys, we shouldn't say things just by saying, Manabii, like Jacob, fought with God, and here someone anasema hata manabii had several wives. Unatoaga sacrifice ya mbuzi ngapi to make God agree with your movement? Bro the story yako ipo poa but don't mix it with Christianity or the Bible; you are ruining it all, unaondoa flavours ya story. I pray God may restore your soul and help you to run back to him."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lucky man❤🎉 lucky ladies❤🎉
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah deserve better,she is a good virtues woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly, what is the moral of the story???"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So wife no,3 atakuha lini"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn seek God and don't go out  of him this union is also tricky
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bibi mdgo aende atafute bwana.....Aachane na ndoa ya wenyewe....😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,i pray to God not to finds myself in this life my mother is suffering dew to this same to us and also even in campus 3 people cannot leave in the same house one person must be excluded
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hamwoni hata Maureen wamematch..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Until this abraham and the second wife  will understand what the bible say and  that what they did is a total sin , they will be delivered. U cant stay with 2women and feel confortable and and believe that heaven is urs my dear change ur mind coz u are digging hell  .... Stay with one plzzz even ur family they cant tell u really? The second will get somebody else !!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mauren should just come out of sbdy husband, marriage bed should not be defiled ,find your husband  and if not wife no 3 must come"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a beautiful story. Polygamy is okay as long as there is respect in the union. All marriages, plural or singular, have their challenges. Africans who argue that polygamy is unchristian are confusing Christianity with eurochristianity - the scandal of particularity, I.e., the fact of the incarnation, is such that Christ came to a particular Jewish culture not so that everyone would become a Jew, but so that everyone would encounter God in their own cultural contexts. Missionary efforts that were integrated with colonial agenda disrupted the African way of thinking and added confusion to a vibrant way of life. The Mzungu munafuata with their manifesto of monogamy are practicing serial monogamy - marrying and divorcing day and night… eurochristianity is based on an ethics of right(s), while African society is based on an ethics of responsibility. This is a show of responsibility from this family. I bless them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The comments are soo negative towards the second wife. Most people who are negative on comments, they are dating people’s husbands and may never be married EVER! There are many women than men so there are less men. This is beautiful, I Love it and admire these ladies, they are so pure and genuine 。"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for sera cos personally i cannot agree such nonsense in my life.
Maybe for sera to accept this.... they are beyond friendship to lesbians"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is demonic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Her mind is so much colonized
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lnn ni mzungu mweusi
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is nothing to learn 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sitted here wondering why would we women not love themselves and choose to please a man and consider his happiness first eeeeh hii one person is in absolute pain but for the fear of starting again she chooses this eeeh this isn't biblical
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham was a father of many nations. What a blessed man!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I want to follow this people for the next five years. This kind of life is not sustainable at all. It will definitely end in tears for some people. Actually Abraham has pulled a curse upon himself by betraying sera . Let's watch and see.

It's such a painful situation to think of.😭
May the lord heal sera for the pain she's going through.

Abraham and sera! They're meant to be. Maurine is like the concubine"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women learn to choose yourself first❤❤❤❤no matter what!!!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walipotelea wapi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Foolishness
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one would love to experience this honestly... The man took advantage of how much sera was into him and loved him
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham should man upa and get serah her house and the other one  hers
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sin is shameless
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waliendanga wapi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is very clear  that Abraham loves Maureen more, he thought Serah would leave but got surprised that she allowed to stay with her co-wife. So sad, i feel for Serah😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some are brainwashed to believe the whitemans writings (editions) will take them to heaven.
That before christianity all africans went to hell and their Muslim brothers will end up there."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is satanic and generational turmoil
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hawa wanatuona matako zao
Semeni mnapenda Threesome na thats satanic na mnatumia God hapo ndani"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless this family - Zimbabwe
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really admire it. Nice and very humble family.  God bless you
q4sWUJxjc4g,I still sense pain and hurt in serah's voice
q4sWUJxjc4g,PR things
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pure nonsense!one man,one woman..as per God's statutes!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pastor Ezekiel would say ,hapo hakuna ndoa'.Maureen hana nyota ta ndoa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife is not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn bring us a person  who can speak pure gospel over this issueof marriage coz this is not Godly so called many wives at all ,read for them Matthew 19:4_6.
Let pple not live in lie over their hardness of their hearts Matthew 197_8 n immorality n come to cheat us . nonsense no love here ,evil teaching to young generation.
Pastor T Mwangi uko wapi hii gospel teach them the truth n the truth will set them free wewe Haggai toka Kwa sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy will still cheat the two wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Red flag no. 1. His sole motivation in asking her to move in was how she cleaned his house and washed his clothes. 
Red flag no. 2. She moved in with him without a committment.
It is clear to me he got entangled with Cera out of convenience. But when he met Maureen, it was true love. 
Unfortunately because Cera loved him more than he loved her and more than she loved herself, she tolerated the nonsense. 
If she had left him when he started this Maureen crap, maybe he would have come to his senses and seen what she meant to him. But she was too fearful with her kids and stayed. And now her goose is cooked. They are still mistreating her but now because shes gone along with it, she doesn't know how to get out.
Cera it is not too late to claim back your dignity. Leave this loser of a man and find yourself."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is evil and i dont support
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't like the way he looks at Cerah...hakuna Chemistry...wewe Maureen.. back to sender...we will go to kataloni for Cerah .. you are EVIL ........ this man has no self control...he will just see another light one...UTA DUU?..
BOTTOM LINE...Cerah I pray for you... something isn't right"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No lady is comfortable, with number 2,3,4.,.. example 1: sarah in the bible, asked Abraham to sleep with the maid because she couldn't bare a child. When the maid finally conceived and bore a son jealousy arose.
Cerah follow your gut, feeling, your instinct says otherwise. No one is ever comfortable with this arrangement, people compromise because, they become dependent on MAN..
Cerah Allow God to turn your situation around. God is not a respector of persons. .."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1. Mistake number one, why are we paying for 2 houses, come we live together.
See the ending.. ladies that is narcissistic language.
# know your worth, a serious Man we take you from daddy's house"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Usherati pro max
q4sWUJxjc4g,Honestly speaking cerah isn't happy ...Maureen is just an home wrecker and the guy is arrogant glorifying cheating ...I pray God will open doors for Cerah so that she can find love elsewhere 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its Cera holding that stew-paid marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is not hippy but forced to accept
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1. The only person benefiting from this dynamic is Abraham. He is preying on Maureen's lack of self-respect and, Serah's lack of adequate self-love. The pranks and titles on their YT page are so cringe. The fact that they are edited and posted by Abraham makes them even more distasteful.
2. Abraham is a selfish man who refused to man up and tame his lust. There is nothing honourable about what he did. He disrespected Serah and chose his personal interests at her expense.
3. May Maureen know that being upgraded to 'wife' only leaves the side chick slot open for recruitment. A cheat is a cheat and unless he tames his lust, he will resume his prowl once the high of the new catch gets old. How you get them is how you lose them.
Anyway, the last post on their YT page was two years ago. I hope and pray that it's because Serah realized that she deserved better and left."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do this fam still exist????
q4sWUJxjc4g,They have.    Spend      time together and they both open to one anotherr
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first one should have a credith
q4sWUJxjc4g,BUSINESS
q4sWUJxjc4g,This ladies and their husband are very proffessional
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woie Serah no woman can be happy with this life,,,Abraham you didn't love Serah hii ni usharati ,,you are sooooo guilty in your eyes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn I love u personally,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is heartbreaking 💔

I can never pretend so much to this level, weeeiiii.😢😢.

Time will tell, Sere, will one day burst and it will be bad, allow this pain come out, deal with it and heal, than to pretend"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So apparently most of the people in the comments section believe one is being hurt despite them all saying otherwise! The unconventional way of doing things will obviously face alot of resistance.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lunn ❤ following up this story,,, this is the real Adam and Eve generation 😅one day I will give you a story of mine I tooked my hubby before we divorced to do HIV test with the wife that her mother gave Him...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If the roles were reversed,would Maureen have accepted cerah as her husband's sidechick being married and brought home to her🤔. Anyway to each their own"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing good abt this....this is ungodly...period!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The mistake Serah did was to go do dishes and cores ..move out from her house go live with a narcissist, opportunist."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just Love how Lynn's chair iko mbali...there is good space😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Awee Abraham na Maureen mwalisamwa...😢 the audity

q4sWUJxjc4g,I totally don’t agree with this.Polygamy is not of God.This man is really selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who knews what happened to these?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weird!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, honestly this is a family which will go nowhere whatsoever.  They are hurting inside but pretending to be well off. Sarah is holding something but expect the blow as the trios are very young and really lack wisdom besides their English is fluent for public show casing.  Bring them again when things can't hold together!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This episode is a mere lie to the public. Lynn, we are hurting to listen to such horrific journey and to Cera...maombi tu!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu ni bumby😅😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't entertain search nonsense, Sera more grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mlienda wapi,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moseti it's okay to love two wives but not okay to live in one home.Move  them in different homes.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My Grandpa had ten wives and the life was so beautiful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"maureen you are wicked very wicked, how do you open your thighs for your friends hubby? n what did you expect Sarah to do, burn you down, this relation is not biblical nor approved by GOd THIS IS RUBBISH"
q4sWUJxjc4g,as a matter of fact am lazy i cant be one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a terrible example these adults are setting for their kids! My heart weeps for the kids and the kind of upbringing they're having - that of normalising promiscuity. If two wives are fine, why not 3, 4, 6, or any other crazy figure? This is a slippery slope..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Tuache jokes

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is foolish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Being a traditional marriage  the man Abraham puts it justifies everything.... Traditionally Abraham is a rea polygamist who can put two wives together under same roof and leave peacefully. Traditionally itis in order
q4sWUJxjc4g,"hey lynn iam in the same situation but mine fire fire all the time

q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is polygamy, there's nothing wrong about polygamy, is their choice of life ,leave them alone,Jocob had two wives Rachael end Leah but God had no problem with that, God continue blessing Jacob and his family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,SAME  LIKE  DR MWAKA   2WIFE    INTERVIEW  ON RADIO      AFTER   ONE   TROUBLE  STARTING      I DONT BELIEVE   KIND OF   MARIED   WASTE OF  TIME

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is a situation where a man over stretch himself for more than one woman, it's a dirty marriage , it's not Godly and all the blessings belongs to the first wife , so stop saying that it's God ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There should be another interview for Serah alone. She is really so hurt and the fear in keeping her in that marriage. Please help her, the man is so toxic."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Hakuna makosa that cera can do that can be compared na yenye MOURINE  ulifanya ya kuchuna mapenzi yake .mjipange tu .stress abrahamu ulijitafutia ao warembo  wako sawa .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine  guys cera is  a unique toto of somebody  full of values  and i think  Abraham took advanntage of her which should never happen to any other daughter  of somebody   let this be first and last an event. But still acaution cera continue being careful Mourine no ..knowing  this is a married somebody   and you  move a head to come with excuses later   cera is very sharp she knows what she is doing    waja Abraham  angangane

q4sWUJxjc4g,Under one roof😢 not women  so.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I sincerely  love your questioning skills none can run a  way or shy away from nothing but the truth.Anyhow let the gentleman  know that it is not right to date and pretend  you love your original wife  no love can be equally  and proportionately  shared its only that the ladies had no otherwise  so even then let him watch  put

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel pity for Sarah she needs assistance
There is no normal woman who can accept a second woman.
She cannot say this out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As much as there are women like this, the ones retaliating are the few ones who won't submit like these two women because they are unique and it can happen. It is their choice and as a person just decide your own sanity and be peaceful and just. If you ever find yourself in this situation it is never going to be exact as this so that makes them unique and life must continue however the society does not support it. It is the same as drinking alcohol or using bhangi lakini watu wanavuta na wengi wanakunywa, yet you have read somewhere it says do not drink alcohol. So ""it is as it is""the guy has decided and he is lucky but everything under this sun is not new, it has happened before. There will be more cases like this because men are few with the heart that this man has. Chini ya maji people are living this life wewe tu ndo hujui na unashtuka ukiona hawa. It has been happening ever since time started BC and AD. Things are not the same as it used to be⌚"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh, poor Sera, Maureen. Learn from the Dove, let nature teach you. If Maureen was the first wife, she couldn't take it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Crap! Raw crap! These are  relics of ancestral stronghold of polygamy. The guy needs deliverance.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn nakubali maswala yako yako powa sana

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen should have respected herself and stayed away from him when she found out that he was married

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I polygamy, only one part wins (a ma), women why do we fail ourselves so much, who we allow men to get away with it every time, why do we compromise our lives and happiness because of people who never loved us. as women we should understand that we don't own human beings we partner with them if they don't want our partnership anymore, we have the right to quit, whether you are first or second wife, chose yourself."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Today I must comment, Abraham don't take insults you are a super man and you fight for what makes you happy. Kudos"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Women are desperate nowadays 😂
This is ridiculous"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel it for Sera😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing wrong with this as far as they are both okay there is no husband and wife in heaven this is beautiful enjoy your life Gods will is for us to Happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow that was uncomfortable to watch
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a sweet soul Sera .God will give you your own husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abuu you are mentoring many. Share the tips bro, I'm following"
q4sWUJxjc4g,soap opera!
q4sWUJxjc4g,its okay marrying a second but there is no need living together in the same house.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wyf is suffering inside 😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham was never honest from the beginning, when a man marries you traditionally only, this is just what to expect. He's incapable of loving any woman, you all just put his life together."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera its better you leave this scenario and watch how this their soo called love crumbles, you are the one fueling their sinful union, i took myself out of a similar situation, just trust God. He doesn't love any of you, you need to destroy that devilish ego"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can we have an update on this marriage?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At the end of the day,,,one woman will find her way out of this thing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This talk makes love look like a real scum..... And I don't think its inspiring but only teaching cheaters more tricks and men learning how to disrespect their wives based on infidelity..   am not pleased in any way
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I dont know if anyone was inspired after this story i mean no matter how good they decorate it it still not feels right, this one we should unlearn guys its painful i can see it thru Serahs eyes she is drowned and grow cold, to them they think its easy but in this equation Serah's peace and integrity is the one that has dipped into a whole lot of shadow of herself, she is not sure how to begin from but i can tell she there for one reason and the other not love,real love cant found in that kind of circle. Period!!!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If the 3rd one is not brought there will be at least two more baby mama's outside this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everyone is denial here. Give it time the truth will reveal if Ceral is really happy. I feel for her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can you imagine he’s telling this lady such intimate things about Sarah while Sarah is just an egg doner to his kids I have been in this position unknowingly this is a narcissistic man the woman don’t care one bit about Sarah none of them do if Sarah leaves they will destroy each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mr Abraham thank you so much for coming out clear i really support you Maureen and serah congratulations girls for accepting each other may God protect you both end your family i wish you both nothing but the best of lack 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah tjooo, as long he did it at first he will do it again.... Let's wait and see"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is a reason why this one has 11k comments and over 1milion views
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What I know is, one woman cannot satisfy one man. Ladies woke up and allow your men to have a second wife who is not stubborn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What i can say Sarah must stay there bt with a purpose,,this man said ge cant say the percentage of love btwn the two,,Sarah jipange❤❤❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It total life of pretence,no love, no God in this marriage and this is full of stupidity, immorality am a married woman and I will never stand this 😭😭😭😭😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is very crafty,  knows how to pick his words, his a sooth sayer, con man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's no way you can love 2 people,  u love the 2nd one and you tolarate the 1st one"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why not get a different house
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's obvious he settled for Serah because he felt she could make a good wife and Maureen seems to be the lastest rebound and since maureen might be enterprising and financially bouyant he doesn't want to lose what he stands to gain being with Maureen... Remember, he said he was financially less bouyant than Serah too...Seems he love to use women to climb up the financial ladder.This man doesn't love them both and only loves himself....very sad to see😢.....with watching it to the end, he obviously values Maureen more than Sera and scared of loosing Maureen, and doesn't care if he looses Serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah should plan to leave ASAP otherwise the longer it will take to heal. Evidently she's hurting!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So ungodly, irritating and annoying, hugs to you Serah, wewe Maureen you will pay for what you did to Serah. Don’t say I didn’t warn you,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We need the follow up
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn we need an update 😬
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So much hidden, a sad story hidden in laughter 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My point of view
Abraham you betrayed this beautiful soul called serah
Moureen you are a home breaker
Lastly Abu stop normalizing sin
And even before that why did you love two women when you were cutting sukuma and do you think moureen could have loved you the...just think of in that perspective"
q4sWUJxjc4g,2 years later am here... Trusting the empire is still strong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lets empower ourselves....ati Cera was a full package,,if yes,what package was he looking for in Maurin....justifying infidelity."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What does God say about this 🤔 Even if everyone says it's okay but God says it's a NO, trust me, it's a NO NO NO!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, you should have said NO! to Abraham. 
You wouldn't die... Always ask yourself before making any decision,  ""What does God want me to do in this case?"" This will always make you make Godly decisions...am sad that they are normalising adultery and have no atom of regret 😪😪😪😪😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂 where are these people
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let us listen to them. Every family has its history so this is their own.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki  what is this? I don't  know what  to say but this is not right ...at allllll....waaaaah...not  right!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Njeri wa Migwi come see this kind of abuse Serah is going thru
q4sWUJxjc4g,2 narcissists 1victim. May God come through for Cera.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh mkona nguvu huku nje...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn in true sense love is something that no one can explain,it's grows from deep in one's heart , congratulations family 😍💝"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wait to my observation cerah decided to bring her enemy close
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is a bustard may you stroke when you are talking nonsense....reduculus
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But they are trying to redefine sin in their own terms to fit in. Everything is permissive, but not Godly. My take though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"okay as a woman, one thing u shouldn't do, dont let him know that you know there's another woman because if actually he knows that you know he will make it official"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He is a selfish Man ,as long He gains,He does not care at who's cost as long as He gets what He wanted."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ngugi.....I wonder whether this story is still the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are very light? So shallow and stupid,Sarah is NOT light,no surprise why you are in this situation.Sarah looks  💯 percent uncomfortable 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The sarcasm in sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is purely  NONSENSE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah ,,,i feel like breaking when you  started  from low n  together only for morine to admire this man ,,,,,,I feel your pain ,nut wewe no different"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Any other woman apart from your youthful wife is a counterfeit wife from the devil ,,God is not involved at all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,these guys are not happy at all ni humanity tu wwakonayo towards each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,You guys you doing wonderful things but don't bring the third wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Madness just... Period.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is no truth for two married women living in the same house because they love each other.  There is a lot of hypocrisy in this relationship, suppose your husband dies before you two,  think about it, would you still continue living together in the same house as cowife's who 'love' each other.  What plans do you have for the future concerning your relationship and the way you will live even in your old age...  I just see hypocrisy and pretense..waaah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati bahati, bado aliuma nje kwa game😂😂😂😂😂😂😂pole sana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,30 by the time they hit 50 He wont yell like he is he yelling today this is a starting point.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like the way lynn ask Maureen and Abraham questions
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera just take  it from me wait for another woman she is coming  that is what they once told me but i ended up losing the man and family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, you were very wrong to marry someone’s husband. You shouldn’t have engaged in this…awful you’re . I hope one day you will regret these awful actions and apologise to Sarah 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Intimate love is ever jealous,,the first wife just lacked a choice but to fake the coexistence,,,,,Even her facial tells much,,,,,,,,this should never be encouraged"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You are a destroyer maureen, it doesn't matter how you sugarcoat it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, it's sinful to break a family. You trapped him with a child. I don't agree with polygamy. Sarah is hurting. It clearly shows."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""We as the women of this house"" .....puhlease."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"10 minutes in, I am so gaslit I just can't."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Guys stop talking your language coz we also want to get the story clearly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ano where are these guys? The empire?
q4sWUJxjc4g,This was a good interview I enjoyed it!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It surprises me how a man will shamelessly come on the midia and proudly talk about his infidelity. Its a shame. Abrahim is a shameless and selfish man. He is using these two beautiful ladies. See how heartbroken Sarah has been.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God remember their children, I pray for their future. Kindly take dowry to the ladies parents ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They should show me where in the Bible God said that you should have multiple wives. Keep God out of whatever this is because if He was at the forefront this situation would never have occurred.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walienda wapi hawa the Abrahams family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am seeing most comments here, African women has to learn , we don't know men at all most women think they are the only woman with their man but men has women out there at least i aplaude  this brother because he is accountable and he is a real king cause he is keeping his family together and guys read your bible very well its not a sin to have wives , its the wersten system that has conditioned us to see this as a sin"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wako aji after 2 yrs

We talking from experience, the earlier the better or are so beautiful my sister. Acha kusikia kama umefinyiliwa you look helpless but you have more power than you thought😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Now we're talking polygamy is the way to go in this world
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"if love is infinite to the extent you can love the two at the same time. what stops this infinite love from loving the third , fourth and fifth ,,, True love knows boundary , daah , hapa hakuna hiyo love with limits"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where are these people?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love you guys!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor sarah you are a beautiful woman but you lack selfconfidence and that made you stayed with that narcissist
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man doesn't love his wife Sarah.  Very manipulative man
q4sWUJxjc4g,it is okay us a muslim person men can married two or more
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's nothing like going beyond love. Stop fooling yourself. God Himself is love and beyond Him there's none

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wanawake wawili ni nyungu mbili za urogi, it's better to protect them having different homes! When  the man dies today the home can never be the same again!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your dad had an instinct of fear he saw it coming
q4sWUJxjc4g,So help me God🚶🚶🚶
q4sWUJxjc4g,A man can never love two women at once. Full stop.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a man who is proud to be a polygamous man and he found women who were ready to live in a polygamous home. Sarah I must say is beautiful and calm. She has a charm and charisma and desert better than a polygamous man. However they choose to find peace in their business.
q4sWUJxjc4g,🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤ flowers for them actually this family looks amazing full of love and they are one 🎉🎉 but i was caught listening to the earing sounds the 3 ladies weeuh i am just smiling and laughing 🤣 😊 this flow is pure from the look stop judging 😢😢 people and you ain't in their shoes 😢😢😂😂

q4sWUJxjc4g,NO SIR i dont want to emulate you!.This is SIN not marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"YOOOO   I CRY  ABOUT   OUR UNCESTORS WHO ENDORSED  THIS  NON SENSE.
MEN CHEAT ALL THE TIME BUT ITS BETTER  U DON'T  HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER  OTHER WOMAN. 
U BRAIN WASH YRSELF THAT U RE THE ONLY QUEEN.
SHAME I LL WALK RATHER THAN TO SEE THE OTHER WOMAN. 
I KNOW ISITHEMBU IT DESTROY S EVEN KIDS.I M FROM IT I HATE IT TILL DEATH 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some people  are selfish  ooh God!!  trust  me one of them is unhappy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is evidently older than Abraham and Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen will leave that marriage because God is fighting for Sarah just wait and see what will happen to that marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen should go look for her own husband,that is a sin"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Follow up 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wamepotea mtandaoni...where are they?

q4sWUJxjc4g,I am unable to watch this interview. I am sorry
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Dear Serah, i really hope you are cooking up a plan to eventually leave these two selfish people... Please"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ndio akue single mother kama wewe🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let us NOT sugar coat this : Abraham met his SOUL MATE after being with Serah....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Going beyond love can be translated us "" Selfishily having a cake and eating it and the women allowing you to do eat it nicely"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There must be another one

q4sWUJxjc4g,English only please😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women empower urselves please
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmmmmm this is no good at alllllll
q4sWUJxjc4g,1:38:47 1:38:49
q4sWUJxjc4g,What an interview/conversation!!! The discussions give a re-definition to love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy isn't capable of loving anyone but himself. If he wasn't satisfied with having one wife what makes you think he won't get a third
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sara  is just a  super strong  woman  that you can find on earth, and the fact that you both  of you have understood  and accepted  the situation  you find yourself  in,

q4sWUJxjc4g,NOT GOD’S DOING!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,My days this is not good at all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't share a man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Maureen need to repent. Ceerah deserves a better man than this crap.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah made a mistake from the beginning by accepting Maureen into their family coz right now they couldint be together  Maureen could have bn married by now with another man ladies pls never make such a mistake tutaonana mengi iyo upole yako Sarah!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No one can serve two masters equally.
No man finds 100% of all he is looking for in one woman. At best, he finds 80%. So, Mr. Abraham is getting almost 100% because the spouses are somehow 'complementing' each other and the wives are, in turn, trying to complement him. However, attempting to make something different from the original work is not child's play. -- Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-5; Ephesians 5:31; Ecclesiastes 7:9."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cant accept this nonesense,  this man is a pretender, maureen rem the bible says whoever come in btw two married pple is death, lets see you after 5 yrs,  and tell us their story again"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wat i can see here is maureen is the exciting thing for him becos hes still in the honeymoon period with her ,until it fades usually after 5 years with kids he'll move on to another. R we reading same bible ?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sometimes, with africans, they just do wat they know wat their parents did polygamy, if ur xtian the old testament shouldn't be the compass , new testament says no polygamy , but people hide behind culture."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He gave serah an ultimatum and cos he said he wouldnt leave maureen , she got stuck and had to go with the flow😢 men can be cruel, its every mans dream 😮wat r  the kids going learn, the way they r exalting him too even though he cheated 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"8 years is long to be with a woman , so to take another woman is cheating, and to even hv a kid without wife knowing  , 😮but these days everything seems to go, only God knows and can judge, as Creator of the universe , he gives the laws our job we hv to abide , he says 1 wife , no cheating or adultery. Also men with money get away with lots women need to get financial independence to avoid being vulnerable.even intelligent women end up being degraded and act like they r confused."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can the women have/love more than one man is the question? Since there is soooo much love to give!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is not happy at all she's just faking
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn I have watched many of your shows. this time, this is not a good one. I don't find any moral lessons in this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Funny people
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Are this people still together? 
I have a feeling they are not"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"may GOD keep this family together, may they get over all the huddles."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"there is no villian in this story,
two married beautiful ladies,
one lucky dude..

wow"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"57:15
this is one lucky guy..
congs again"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"guys this is ok. 
all the patriachs in the old testament had multiple wives..

q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is right man for the  chairmanship  of men
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is nonsense. I don’t care how sugar coat it. Sarah is subdued by two people who think they are smooth 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray cerra get healled l feel she is not totally healed. The second wife shoul have booked this guy for goood after finding out he is married
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham betrayed carra
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guys is not genuine l see him in future having the 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham should not defend his lust and those women are only acting.Out of fear they have to say what Abraham wants to hear.
I'm even bored.
Don't be surprised when Abraham brings in a third, forth, fifth wife.
Think about our Lord Jesus Christ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah is still far more gorgeous 😅.😂😂😂.The God that did it for them should avoid my generation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Marriage is God's idea and its a typology of Christ and His bride - the church. How many brides does  Christ have? How many women did God create for Adam? Does the bible say man love your wives or your wife? Immorality is Immorality no matter how you want to look at it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you need more Grace I swear
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is inadequate and uses this situation to make himself feel good. He doesn't care about neither one of these women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Rather than becoming public property, it is better to become private property that belongs exclusively to you.

The 3.8 billion women of this world still cannot find a husband. So what is the solution to this surplus? Polygamy 👈


They should also be solution for this problems.

2-Alcohol
3-Gambling 
4-Pornography"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham is just selfish and with no heart for cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May this kind of love never locate me, you can't be okay living with your co-wife, this is so wrong. 
Serah sorry for everything that you're going through and dealing with all that but one day you will overcome it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Unless you met them at the same time
q4sWUJxjc4g,I will not stay in this marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂are they still together???!for me it's a shame knowing well that you share the same man
q4sWUJxjc4g,I destroy it in my life in Jesus Mighty name 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He has put some heavy juju on them, no coming out"
q4sWUJxjc4g,A MAN CAN LOVE ALL OF HIS WIVES. BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ummmm I won't do this never... This is not right some one is hurting deep inside
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mbona naskia sadness watching this?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dont think they are so inlove with him .They can accept the situation when they are not so in love with him and lets them make their own money .The real issue is standing before the seat of judgement .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That man is selfish.  SARA seems like she doesn't have any choice . He pursued that lady and got her pregnant.  I wonder if he can satisfy both of them . Deep down, I think Sara is not happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Whatever your husband wants to do, he should also offer to you!  If he wants new romance from another, then his wife should have the choice to have it too.  What’s for the goose is also for the gander. 

I hope Serah has had those options and have the freedom to choose to enjoy them.  No one truly knows what goes on behind closed doors.  

It is crystal clear that he cheated on his wife, the mistress knew she was the side chick and very transparent that Serah did not agree to this deception.  Seems she has succumbed to it, but is not internally at peace with it.  Serah should also find comfort in another man level out her bruised ego (if she hasn’t already done so).  Her husband has no legit reason to oppose it or even have negative energy towards it because it is he who brought the entanglement into their marriage.  He is a selfish, and Serah had better jump on board and take charge of her own happiness by rearranging those arrangements!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please don't say it's God's doing
q4sWUJxjc4g,NARCISSIST NARCISSIST
q4sWUJxjc4g,He wants he's cake and eat it as well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor Serah you are suffering inside. Please get some self confidence
q4sWUJxjc4g,The husband is totally unaware of the situation and against the word of God. He sound and act like a total narcissist. I am disgusted that they should be interviewed. And Maureen should be ashamed having a child with a married man
q4sWUJxjc4g,My grandfather had 3 wives to cut the long story short the home is chaotic.This looks different hope kids will continue with the peace

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn is very goo in asking sensitive questions, but hiyo kuwaweka in one house haimbambi hataa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,A man without self control is like a city broken into..Prov 25:28. The guy could not protect his marriage. The second wife invaded another's marriage cunningly cos she had an opportunity not to. For every temptation there is always a way of escape. This is not good moral to our children.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don’t know why people would blame Maureen when this guy Abraham is the one who broke his covenant with his wife. He has no concept of love. He says, “Put love aside.” It’s all about “Abraham’s empire.” Only in Africa! What kind of good role model father is he is do the children, really? It’s quite disrespectful to Serah; she didn’t have a choice! Furthermore, These women are both victims."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"So sad it purely portrays that Maureen is a money maker in your life, you picked on her for money deals. Unfortunately this gonna backfire on you not now but later."

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a blessed home. U r proving that sincere communication is the key and unity is love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a great blessing and a lesson to many. Sir feel blessed and respect these wonderful God's given wives. Do u people know that even Mary mother to jesus wasn't the first wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This situationship is wrong on all levels. This man is selfish and he only thinks of himself. He can't even answer if his actions hurt Serah's feelings. Why? Because he simply doesn''t care. He intentionally also hid his relationship from both ladies and says he didn't want to lose them. Like really... and Maureen knowingly walked into someone else's marriage. She is even short of words because there is nothing to explain! Weuh! One man, one wife. That's how it was intended in the beginning so let's not glorify anything else. When the family is not upright, the society will not be upright either."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am highly impressed by the narratives of Abraham Mwangi's two wives, about how they interact with one another. Mwangi, you are blessed."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Can the ladies plz leave this man. He doesn't have self control.  He is still going to bring another woman.  He is a womanizer and the women are allowing him
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Every time  this world brings  us new stories, new characters , new things etc on scene .. We are so used to bad people thats why  but even good people do exist  though very few or that we often dont happen to hear most heroes  such as  Cerah and Maureen. . heroes of forgiveness, love and beautiful hearts .o exist. Time will tell us about these two women .. Good thing they have brought their story to the public eye .. 
For Abraham ,he is not right with God and not right with his wives ... He is just a lucky guy he has these two ""beautiful souls ""
 Time will tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"you can love 4 girls and marry , you divide your heart and time among the 4 wives"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Lets all respect Cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,what I admire about this boy is his choice of words
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is a super understanding woman coz she doesnt want abraham to cheat or do things behind her coz she loves abraham unconditionally and doesnt want to lose him but by the looks of sarah it speaks of how she is trying to hold the pain that has been eating her from inside from the day she knew abraham had a kid out of marriage.I think sarah should consult a psychologist for therapy sessions bcz PTSD caused by this incident of another family may shorten her years.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a cheater,  wait he will bring another one and you welcome."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't be me

q4sWUJxjc4g,What would Abraham feel if any of the ladies got another man?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow I love this, both are beautiful thank u serah for the good heart, may God blessings be upon both of u."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's very clear that man loves Maureen more than his first wife,she's such a calm and lovely woman bambi"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man would be wishing he never married the first wife.  My opinion! If you really loved your first wife you wouldn't be cheating on her with the side chick.  The first wife had no option hence allowed peace.  Men can never be trusted,  but ladies stay off married men!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a heartwarming family! May God bless and sustain your happiness as you continue to thrive together. It will also interest to note that in the Bible, those God considered after His heart often had more than 1 wives. This video exemplifies the beauty of love and unity within the family structures. Thanks for sharing this unique and inspiring story!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I love their experience and their bravery
q4sWUJxjc4g,"‭Proverbs‬ ‭5:18‭-‬20‬ ‭KJV‬
Let thy fountain be blessed: And rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a stranger?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man spoke like a very inconsistent and greedy man. You can never eat your cake and have it. Not fear the way you treated Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Despite the explanations, Serah is just low🤔She'll never forgive you Abraham 😒"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"God deliver me from this in jesus name, Someones hubby is on my neck and i dont wanna be maureen in jesus name"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am have gone through the comments and am in wonder. If the white missionaries didn't bring christianity to Africa would we be having these issues of demonizing polygamy? God blessed our forefathers more than we are today....financial constraints is what is making men to not marry two or more women. I hope one day people will unshackle from religious shackles. Its best when as a woman you know who your husband is than him hiding and after many years and your youth is gone....unagundua he has another family elsewhere then you feel betrayed Lets be real. I am happy they are making it work.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Keep asking in english
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've loved this show b'se it's in english
q4sWUJxjc4g,Any woman who accepts this arrangement from a man and masks it as if all is well needs a therapist.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the two women love this man so much that they accept the polygamous marriage. This is the only way for her not to lose this man. It helps them to be best friends and really live it out. I couldn't love two men at the same time. I only have one heart and can't give it to two men. but I think it's possible for men.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Update

q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissistic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something funny with Christian women is that they always think the biggest sin in life Is when a man sees another woman and he is already in a relationship..Christianity is a scum because Muslims marry more than one woman and they have the happiest families.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This seems stage managed
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nope

q4sWUJxjc4g,He's just a selfish man who doesn't really care about any of the women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You have fans like myself in England, and it’s difficult to follow the conversation when you speak your language sometimes, and in so doing encourage your guests to also speak your language. Decide whether your show is for your country’s audience and present totally in your language, but if you would like your audience to grow beyond your country, Africa & the world, then consider how your mixture of English  & your language leaves we non-speakers baffled about information we hear in your language, but we don’t understand  a word. Thanks."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's a blessing. Cherish it and much love. Having two or more wives is not new. As long as you guys love one another and raising your kids together.  Thats the most important thing. Respect and love is the foundation of a happy marriage. My first cousin brother has two wives too. Congrats to your family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wat God joined together not man separate the second wife nah pathon
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Here, everything is complicated and complex."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is possible to live peaceful with your co wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah God has a husband for you darling . Let Abraham have one rib removed  Bambi dear Jesus loves you and wants the best for you.he will get for you a handsome man for yourself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii hapana ...dont sugar coat infidelity.The first wife should know her worth and walk away.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Opion, opinion. Are like butt holes, everyone have one.mainly women, in the  comments. the 12 tribes of Israel  is of 4 women. May the Most High blessing continue in their family, peace!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abomination, be sure judgement will come!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera said she's never been lucky....true to it...one day sera uta hit jackpot...your own empire❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wanawake wengine wana nguuvu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi lyn, can you cover my family's story? Its more or less the same and am sure it will inspire so many polygamous families. How can i reach you?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He cheated on his wife plain and simple. 
I believe his first wife feels as if she had no choice, but to accept the 2nd wife. 
Both him and the 2nd wife are terrible people. He has narcissistic traits. 
Having more than one wife should never be carried out in this way. 
I hope one day Sara will find the courage to leave.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is fornication
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah you deserve better.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel bad. This is so wrong. Everything is wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a man, I know for sure that I cannot live with two wives, as Abraham is doing. It's too much work, too burdensome! And, I doubt that Maureen would do what Sarah has done (share her husband with another woman), if the roles were switched."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Whare is Abram and the family?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please God deliver cera it's too painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woi pole cera but she deserves better than this
q4sWUJxjc4g,hi Lynn. i believe a man can love two ladies at ago. the problem is getting to convince them that they all equal b4 you. i salute this ladies for love and coordination they are showing to ensure thier marriage is strong forever
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like that Cera says she will leave in like a year or so. atleast that makes the story almost normal. I dont think its possible to be 100% with another woman sharing your man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I understand the polygamy but why the same house?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Look for your man,yellow paw.its too annoying, my husband wanted to try it,that my parents want to meet u n my new wife they chat with you,i straight up told him,i cant,and will never! We separated ,he regretted,still with her but pleading to get back,i too got someone whoz truly mine,imagine,the nonsense. I wd rather stay alone with my kids,than in such a hell"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara you will march to heaven
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I’m really sick of all these men trying to have their cake n eat it too. It’s their way to justifying cheating on their spouse. So let’s convince her that I desire another wife. Many of these men are very selfish. They only thinking of their insatiable egos. It’s not about their wife’s feelings or his children. It’s unfortunate a lot of these women silently suffer in these types of relationships. Many don’t feel they have a choice to be by themselves without all that drama. I’m sorry but this society continues to get sicker n sicker. One day, we will all have to face the judgement seat of the Lord. To hear this man says that the Lord has blest him with another wife on top what he already has is ludicrous. Understand God does not bless mess. Neither does He condone it. Just not a good thing on all levels. Everytime I see these types of marital redefining of relationships it makes me sick to my stomach. Now there are a few women who are taking on multiple partners as well. I 🤦‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But yes, their maturity is commendable...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Lynn Ngugi, these family should avoid sharing their story over and over. You reopen old wounds especially for Serah. And yes there is no justification for cheating unless you had clearly communicated from the onset that you want to be polygamous."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh the way Abraham looks at Maureen ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Patriarchy is vile. Dude just centred himself thro & thro!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Man very cheating
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Smooth operator 😅, ogopa mwanamume mpole eeeh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hiii kicheko....am waiting for an interview in like  in 5yrs time
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wouldn't want to be caught in such a situation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah am just awed by you. Am still in denial
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great life that is the African  way profitable for  man and two wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One is sad in her heart. No name mentioniog, but I see and feel it. Nonetheless, to each his own, so thats their choice or maybe not all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Match made in heaven????
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cheating is Cheating
q4sWUJxjc4g,He loves molly than sara
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like u show lynn, if he  was honest from the beginning it's ok, i really want to know if was around if he will support   his wife. U all have daughters i really want to know if someone do that to u daughters. For u woman i hope u know what u showing u kids and i hope u ready for number 3"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see nothing wrong in it ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man’s leaving the life of a life time❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lyn, I like the way you did this interview! you asked very pertinent questions."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm here wondering what will happen when he meets another lady that will have another helpful relationship
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For none reason, I can share my husband with another woman, because in the beginning was in so, God created one man and one bring out of that man one woman, not many, thx"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can you accept, Sarah to marry another man,and do the same way, because the Bible says that,do what,if the do it to you,you will be happy. Thx"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy is smart...he wants soft life..House cleaner and professional favors..the rest ego...
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a selfish man who was happy to get his way. Now he portrays himself as a Saviour of lonely single women. You are a bad example to your sons and it is quite unlikely that they will get a docile wife like Sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am proud of this family. You are a luck man to have two wise women around you. I would be more happy them continuing staying together and raising the family and wellbeing of the children and unit. Do not listen to people, live your life and grow. I hold you with high respect man on the manner you are managing your family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God have mercy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is conning who here?. Of course the first wife isn't happy. She is trying to cope with the whole mess of the arrangement. It's sad. Seek God for your right direction.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,So basically this started as adultery the worst form I would say because he even had a child outside of his marriage.  Abraham and Morine are so wrong for doing what they did and to rub salt in the wound he brought her in as a second wife. There’s nothing Godly about this union at all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would like for both ladies try to have something with other partners; and lets see how functional it can be.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, Sarah n Haggai??? Truly nothing is new under the sun"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eh hapana!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a narcissist. He is feeding his own ego . Note the response he gave his wife when asked about the other woman. Narcissists will always move on to impress the next source , and that’s exactly what this guy did. He will not stop, I doubt.Cera didn’t have a choice . She did a mistake at first by not giving the man the chance to chase him and learn him also. Ladies court your men, you will see the red flags 🚩."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is evil. You can’t love two women equally. One day you’ll see this women go their separate ways.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You're defying God's principles and saying that you're grateful to God for bringing your lustful polygamous lifestyle together?

Your life is dirty and very disrespectful to God and the sanctity of marriage and it WILL NOT last"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If a man can bring in another woman in the home and call her a second or third wife THEN the woman should be able to bring in another man and call him her second or third husband.

I would love to see the reaction of the man in this situation. What is good for the goose is also good for the gander"
q4sWUJxjc4g,nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,❤❤❤❤❤❤goodness Maureen and Sarah are the best ever.❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,❤❤Boom Boom❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham,Sarah and Haggai😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He said he's a Christian, what type of Christian?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That Maureen is an intruder,tell her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor Sarah, God will vindicate you. We Maureen go get your husband..its just a matter of time that man will see the true colours and poor man will suffer. Maureen you are young and beautiful go to your man.Put yourself in Sarah's shoe.Abraham you have Sarah let haggai go."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is an amazing story to hold up high and be proud of being Africans and cherish for Polygyny. You are keeping Africa alive. Many more Africans should embrace freely Polygyny. Women should embrace their African men and unite to them to make great families and protect yourselves and build wealth all the family together. It is the only way go guys!

Look to the West with their values, how shallow they are. Actually the West is disappearing slowly but surely."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its really hard to defend evil.Maurine cant even explain how things happened
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the lust of the flesh! End of story! The ' WORD' stands! I pray that sooner or later thelr eyes will open!
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂 this man is a true example of abraham in the bible who married serah and gave birth with hagar .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very intriguing story
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is an angel ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is crazy😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow nice...
q4sWUJxjc4g,But why serah and Abraham 🧐
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am definitely not sharing my man, he is mine and I am his, END of story. Give me a break! What a blasphemy!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a scam cant allow this in my life
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera need to fast and go before God
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What am seeing here, if it were to the second wife she wouldn't have accepted it forget all this pretenets Maureen is not a good person"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It takes very special people to sustain such relationship. One can question the wisdom in getting a polygamist marriage. It does, however, require great wisdom to keep the family together polygamist or monogamist…obviously more so polygamist."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,This morreen is a pretended she  look evil how can a woman come to another woman and settle down crazy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham dont  love anyone  even himself.asking him is a confused to him.all he want sex eith these foolish wome who have no respect to themselves
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do to people like how you want people to do  you.Abraham you have no respect for cer ah.she is just there because she doesn't know what to do.this is an abuse and women are really abused and they hurt inside but pretend they are not.cerah l just feel for you and l pray one day things will work out for you.this man is a smooth talker and very carefree  and he laughs like a joke.God punish him  very very evil man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This morreen is a house broken pretending she is kind she knows he was married and a bullshit took her to visit the other woman who is like a trapped animal who can't fight for this  stupid married.God will never bless you morreen in this marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We do know that he is not a Godly Man.  Would never marry a Man from Africa.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ladies how would you like it if a man says he was attracted to you  because of the color of your skin!  So does it mean that he could also be attracted to a white woman and would want to bring her  in as a 3rd wife also. Correction not could be attracted to a white woman, these african men are attracted to white woman! That is why he choose these two light skinned woman, their the closest he has come to the white woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Marrine is lieing when she said that she wasn't interested in him and that she was just focused on her job! Well if that was so, then how now you then become a wife to him knowing that he was already married. She lie, she and him was having an affair while  Sara was  unbeknownst to her husband winning and dinning another woman! One thing about african woman is that they have been conditioned to get a husband, so they have this mindset of pick me! Even if it means sharing the man with another woman, how sad is that! This man is laying with both these woman spreading bacteria and Deseases amongst them both, understand that if one of those woman has cancer that it is spread to the other one as well,  or even a yeast infection, or Clamidia"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He was cheating on the wife i know that  was painful for her 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you rock, l like the way you asked those genuine questions, Maureen well l feel God had a man for you but our impatient can run us up. Abraham is just using these two ladies."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man truly needs to apologize to Cera, l don't think he has a good reason to get a second wife. May God continue to help us 🎉"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Acoding to this story,sera is the empire 🎉we must have many Sera's in the world to reduce the number of single mothers ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this story 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is a wise gal, finally if things go wrong the no 2 will be the one to move out. Cera has invested in that home. Ask any no 2, they cant imagine a no 3 coming. no 2 and the hubby is a team of selfishness. Abraham said they had a conflict with Cera, that why he went for Maureen. To me that's not good enough. Problem solving is key in any marriage. There must be a lot of pretense in that family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera will win with this overwhelming kindness, and these narcissists Abraham and Maureen will struggle with guilt for all the time they will stay with her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Young man you're blind
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sex changed KENYA aspect, this was a Christian country before, but now Satan as gained everything, the country is correct in everything...

CONGO DRC
KENYA
TANZANIA


The three first Christians in Africa before than others countries in Africa before but now occupied by Satan because of poor leaderships governce, medias and musics.... Please pray for these countries please please, Satan is at work in these countries..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is normal in KENYA, because Kenya is #1 in Africa where women's are for sale very cheap, women's there like men on cube..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"lovely. Serah I would want my wife to be as mature as you are. Of course Abraham is also so cool and I congratulate him for loyalty. He has not left either woman for the sake of being with one only. St Paul also said a woman, once married is tied to her husband till death. Tell either lady to never leave the relationship instead of encouraging them to leave. Celebrate this relationship coz compared to fonicators and adultarous people out here, this is so pure, beautiful and honest."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you can go through their phones (husband and maureen), you will find some fishy words about Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham do you know God? Sarah is not happy at all, you didn’t give her a choice 
The way you talk Abraham, you love Maureen more. Sarah is controlled."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen why can’t you find your own man … this is BAD. You feel so comfortable doing this to another woman? Maureen you are not genuine
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Personally,  I don't support their story,  having 2 wives. He cheated on the wife...Immorality, is not God ways.  Sara is still hurt..., Maureen, get your own husband...Is sin you have committed. Lord have mercy.... The man is a big NO👎"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I tell you that this Maureen won't take this if she were in Cerah's shoes. Anyways her Karma is warming up
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is disgusting. He betrayed the wife's trust and he is here blabbing trash.! This marriage is transactional.  I think Cerah is so soft and he took advantage of  that . People around Sarah should please take her for therapy. She has not healed. Lots of bottled up emotions. As for you Maureen , you are nothing , but a home breaker"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is a sweetheart ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One of them is not happy and we all see it. In other news, father Abraham 🎶😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you are a great woman. Very few can torelate this situation. May God bless you dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy has been their since the beginning of men. I support this beautiful union.  You can tell they are leaving there best life with this gentle men.  I approve 100%.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like this family, the happiness prevailing in this house is visible. Good luck to Abraham's family. Watching from Lesotho"
q4sWUJxjc4g,WOW!  In fact both of  them are Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️ May The Almighty God bless your family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you is a good man no matter what I listen to your story so as the ladies they are gorges you a very lucky man you got two lovely wives and three lovely children so far, how many are you going to have/ all the best from New Zealand."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hey you a lucky man do you all 3 sleep in one king bed?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don't marry somebody's husband, that is not right."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Personally, this family is a true reflection of African culture and families. Cerah and Maureen be blessed"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ugh I had to stop watching. He's just a cad who wanted his cake & to eat it. He cheated on his wife, had a baby with another woman. There's no excuse for adultery, & you can hear how he was just concerned for himself, that he'd lose one woman or both. Not concerned he'd hurt his wife. Not concerned hed lied all that time. They both should have left him. Once a cheat always a cheat. He's a manipulator."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hawa walienda wapi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A piece of advice for anyone out there: Polygamy is in the interest of all women that have attained a marriageable age while monogamy is in the interest of some women, but at the detriment of other women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Lynn  what happened to this couple??? The last time 2nd wife was expecting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Disgusting
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera just don't want kelele or drama bt deep she isn't oky. Some things are left unsaid you die with them😢😢😢😢

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly i give kudos to Sarah! it can really be painful! anyways the junior wife also has respect for her senior wife from what they are telling us! but in reality, i felt they are all pretending not to be jealous, but i can tell you that there must be jealousy cos blood is flowing in their veins! well, for me i can't stand it. my name is Akuba king from Nigeria."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah wants a life with peace. She is not too emotional. She is like a ricehalm. She bows when the storm rages and when it is over she straightens her back as a fierce woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's a fierce woman indeed
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If being a fierce woman means what Serah is stomaching,then may the grace of a fierce woman not locate me in Jesus name🙏😃"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@CindyTerry-o5c 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can you please add subtitles for parts where English isn't spoken for those of us who aren't Kenyans?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The 2nd wife hadn't found a husband around thirty, that is why she settled"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is marrying two woman by law possible in Kenya?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham,you are a David in the Bible.
I have realised that most people here don't read the Bible.
It there is a man that God loved so much in the Bible that God says,he has a pure heart as Mine,is David,the King and father of King Solomon.
Sera and Maureen,love God and love your husband 🎉❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hawa walienda wapi? Mko pamoja bado? 
Njokeriaii mitamboini"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a sweet talker whose tongue is coated with sugar. This explains why he lured both ladies. Given chance, he may marry a third woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah needs to stop saying this man has a pure heart.  Maureen and this man are cut from the same cloth...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera don't have choice than to stay in the she is not happy bc is she loves her more n the man is read to leave her for murreen. She don't have choice than to stay n allow murreen to come n join them. If you observe Abraham very well he loves murreen more than Sarah. Murreen is the thief n she is avery smart n clever pretender give so time she will fostraight the first wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some people here are throwing blocks at this family. Many are people are living double, triple or quadra lives. I am happy he does not need to hide anything at last"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is trying to hold into one thing that she felt was luck to her😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is this a real story or a movie from Hollywood?
q4sWUJxjc4g,This works mums are happy hubby is happy above all children are happy stay blessed guys l love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,If many man will do like Abraham children will not be suffering without their father because of selfishness of human being
q4sWUJxjc4g,I admire the family. The man is blessed. As a man and a Christian I used to think polygamy is sinful. Not any more. But polygamy is not for everyone. The man chose based on the values he saw in the two women. Not every polygamous marriage is successful and most monogamous marriages will fail or not enjoy love and happiness. I don’t know why some people or ladies think there is out there one man waiting for them only. Really ? . You may be mistaken. . I admire this man and his love and courage. There are many ladies who will never marry because there are not enough responsible men out there  who are not taken or not gay. Some ladies are waiting for what will never happen. I admire Moureen. She is a high value enterprising woman. If she was my sister I will encourage her on this chosen path. She will win with the family. I wish this family the best. Well done👏👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I almost became a victim coz of love to alady i thank God for saudi i left for my kids. @glory jwillis never share .never for a married man with 4 kids a fresh man soon
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Do you people ever think about God's say in the matter and what your spiritual futures are? If God's word says no to polygamy, is your love a worth while price to pay for any future agony? This Abraham that is so disconected from God ooooo, i wish him God's salvation pronto!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Their true colours will manifest as time progresses
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish them good luck,both of them are beautiful.❤❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What is your definition of adultery or did you skip class the day they taught it?  God, the Author of marriage says, ""marriage is between a man and a woman"" (note singular genders-defined); He brought to Adam a woman, not women.  You see how this philanderous man is trying to re-define what God has defined to justify his carnal polygamous lust. This is the way Satan beguiled Eve to sin and explain away deception.  Be not deceived, God is not mocked."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sorry to say this but sera seems not completely healed, it must have been a painful experience for her, honestly this is not encouraging especially for Christians"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Congratulations Mr. Abraham. You may also consider a third wife

q4sWUJxjc4g,😮Maureen please backout and leave the couple. Abraham  is not the only man in the world. Know Jesus Christ as Saviour & Lord and you will live a fulfilled life. This is nothing but adultery. It is not too late to repent and leave this relationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is the smoothest operator and lucky to have two wonderful ladies. Btw, it's nobody's business if they are happy together."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm un married but i can't date a married man or try to enter between two people... no way 🥺 and this other lady ( second lady) should ask herself what if the husband had brought her a co wife. Sometimes it's good to try and reason out and enter in someone's shoes.  Can she really be calm with it???. I always feel pain to the core even  by just writing "" co wife or sidechicks"" 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks and thumbs up to you guys....may God bless u all..
q4sWUJxjc4g,As a lady I think these guys are faking the whole thing. Women don't like sharing. These faces are hiding something.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Both women are attractive. Maureen has a beautiful voice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Congratulations guys!! I am happy to see you all look happy, I am glad his wife saw the message and asked him about the side chick at the time, the are married men out there cheating on their wives daily and bringing home lots of STD’s, I rather him coming clean to his wife and allowing her to make her own decisions, she is grown and very successful, she could have chosen to leave, but she chose to stay, I am proud of her, it’s working out for them, who are we to judge them, every family has good and bad days so let them be."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Can i buy you coffee?"" This sounds like you are both standing infront of a kiosk that sells coffee and you offer to pay for a cup of coffee for her. 
How about ""may i invite you for coffee?"" Or just, how about a cup of coffee with me?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man was so brutal when he told Cera about his maureen. He's so abusive
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who can help me to unlisten  this show
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is so abusive
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,So he started cheating until the poor woman agrees to this

q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is this polygamy man😢😢😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Never even think your husband is not polygamous. He might have three side-chicks. It's better to be open., and kudos to serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera might be still processing the whole ordeal and time will tell whether she will really stand this or not
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is very beautiful❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Names have power
q4sWUJxjc4g,Umalaya ya wanaume ata kama sijiwezi siwezi fumilia he.if you get somebody better than me plz byebye i can't stay under the same roof with so called co-wife.NEVER ho ni madharau

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Painful story but praise God for     
these ladies although having extra marital affairs isnt Godly at all🤷‍♀️😢😢😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,love this family.  Guys keep going.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please lnny tafuta this family they muted of a sudden
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy Abraham has many women in his life, not just Sarah and Maureen. Player guy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I listened listened and listened. Cereh was betrayed and duped. Abraham said they lived an open book with cerah  but he lied to his wife cerah he was just adulturous. He was never remorse. With cerah knowing that maureen was in the the picture  it was like a rubber stamp to his adultery. Cerah said she realised maureen was going no where. Though never told to cerah she was put in  conditions to choose children or leave. If you choose chirdren this is the package. Man children and another woman. The deception and excuses being used by abraham and maureen of children runs all through. 

Before the child was in the equation there was no justification just a man fallen full of pride.

The deception and children will always be the perfect execuse and justification 
 For maureen she came to settle for another womans husband at all costs period. There is nothing special or peculiar about this case. Seen many co wives living under the same roof these ones are only two for the moment.

 As they shared the was of guilt runs all through. Its a difficult situation to be at.  Maureen is open to posibility of abraham getting more women but cerah seems to be in denial. 

Deciding to accept and settle with such situations does not mean they are ok with it. They are trying to co exist the best way they can. 

This life there is so much deceptions  within realities. I pray people do not have to find themselves in such situations. Its a sad reality"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen Abraham😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ah Kenyans! don't take us to the stone age period. In 2024 surely? The first wife should gather courage and leave. There's no graveyard for a divorcee. Don't lower your standards mama.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walienda wapi🎉
q4sWUJxjc4g,Follow up on these ones. I have a feeling all's not well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray that Maureen finds his own man to marry her and leave Cera with her husband.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The ladies voices is almost the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Do not be ignorant of the devices of the devil. The devil doesn't love unity, and there's division in this family already. The man thought of himself so much that he forgot that Serah had feelings. Men should put themselves in the shoe of women and turn things around, and see how they will feel. Sarah, I pray that the Lord will give you peace all around and wisdom to protect your home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"joh this man is so insensitive and selfish, i pray the lady can find strength to leave one day."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham pls don't add another woman this two are good enough
q4sWUJxjc4g,this two woman have gold hearts although it is not easy and comfortable at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God bless cerah, coz she's the one made Abraham continue standing,, and for Moh u'r there becoz of cerah juz obey her, Abraham is aGod fearing man amejua kubalance wote, from my look hajalalia one side, God bless you people, thanks sana Lynn, i like your show.❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is it what God says or is it biblical??
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor Cera. She pretends to be ok, but she is not....
She said it well:"" It wasn't easy but I had to accept""...

Maureen is just a destroyer😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a conniving narcissist. Plain and simple. To Abraham and Maureen, karma's a bitch"
q4sWUJxjc4g,❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is acting 🎭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those of you worried about Serah and her facial expression you are wrong, that's how she is naturally, she's not stressed up or sad/mad or anything of that sort. (Watch their channel and you will realize that that's her natural demeanor) No one can pretend that long. She even said it herself.  Also people naturally just hate 'the other woman'  and will say all the negative things about her to project their own insecurities....but no one will hate the man for 'cheating' on his wife because he is the one who 'left' his marriage vow. All the same, this is such a happy family and personally, I am very proud of them. Go go go Abraham's Empire. Tunawapenda."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not from kalenjin land 😂😂😂 watapigana wakatane na banga 😂😂😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves Sarah for her neatness and Maureen for her office efficiency. He just loves himself so much!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Self love at its best❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ain't nothing wrong with that
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a narcissist
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly what i think ​@@AdventureKidsSA
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can assure that all the people who are judges in this matter are not better than Abraham some are moved with envy how this family has managed to come together and live a happy life,  some with even one husband they have no peace it's a war continuously and cheating some have given up in relationship. Please people let God be the judge no you,  Jesus embarrassed the Jews who brought a woman whom they claimed to have been caught committing adultery alone which is impossible, where was the man? When they were asked that the one without a sin be the first to cast a stone, we all know what happened. So this is the same situation here please leave the man and his family alone and don't try ti inject evil thoughts into Sarah as if you're holy. I wish you all the best Abraham and your family keep loving your wives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn me i can't allow that never
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are you kidding me you  don't think about Sara  before sleeping with Sara husband  women women  what is our problem?  3 love affairs is dangerous  take it or leave it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't worry the man will marry again. So 2 wife prepre
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a selfish man very selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why did you marry 2 wife? If your wife is a good woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,The 2 wife course pain to  1wife. Please 2Ladies look for your own husband..  Yeye man. Can the man allowed the wife to have 2 husband? Am just asking a question
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man is selfish. Very selfish. He will marry again so. 2 wife prepred  you can see that the 1st wife is not happy. That is it period
q4sWUJxjc4g,As long women can do the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can a woman have 2 or 3 men?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham please love these beautiful ladies and don't add.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is totally uncomfortable throughout the show coz she didn't have a choice because financially she was down when it all unfolded.
Maureen and Mwangi will always be the villains and home wreckers.
The level of hypocrisy in maureen is flabbergastingly disgusting pretending to be concerned with how cera would react when she knows about the affair,why couldn't she say no from the word go.
That home wrecker couldn't  accept cera if things were the other way round.
That Abraham is a narcisst trying to recruit other men in to club disrespect,telling them to rub mpango wa kando in their wives faces."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To me is a big NO  😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maturity
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love conquires everything...Big up Abraham!
q4sWUJxjc4g,42:44:00
q4sWUJxjc4g,What happened guess their is trouble in paradise
q4sWUJxjc4g,If all of you are happy. Does what I feel matter??!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,You Young girls never be married as a second wife one day one time you will cry a lone Maurine don't think you are okey
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah pretends she is okey  but she is not no man can love two lady's the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Heee bana!!!🥺🥺🙆🙆So this man continued to cheat with the 2nd woman and actually had her pregnant and the wife actually found them out?!!😭😭😭Noooo, it can never be pure thing, this whole thing started in an evil way nooo the 1st wife suffered here💔💔her anger will one day come back and this will end in tears."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure evil😮because at least he could started telling his that he wanted polygamy so he decided to cheat mxm
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People see polygamy and accept it because of culture but the process of aquiring that wife, is pure adultery. Nothing blissful about it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy to me and my generation it's NO I've been in that shoes in 34yrs I know
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hawa walienda wapi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ambram focused and look at the second wife than1st it's inevitable where his heart is.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mnaita cheating polygamy 
Juu if this man wanted to marry 2 wives he'd have said that from day 1 to serah 
Anyway happy for you ☺️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,In 20yrs please come back here mtuambie how it'll be
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't encourage our girls to be second wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope he will not bring the third one
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmm sarah had no choice she was forced just to accept what was there
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera should have left right after  finding out about the other woman. This way this man would have had to deal with the consequences of his actions. He may have even realised that he loved Sera. By staying, Sera has devalued herself. We should have the power to walk away when betrayed and cheated on."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, you are a man congrats"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"5 years from now he will bring a new one !!!! “Abraham knows Sara very well”??? Nah more like Abraham knows how to
Manipulate and Maureen you will be victim number 2"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You love a man who has a woman and a child at home? It's always better to walk away from such relationships that will hurt others. There's no excuse for stealing another woman's man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May our children not meet selfish, insensitive, cruel spouses in the name of love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great family. What's terrible is having mistresses and girlfriends in the closet. Their openess and sincerity is a healthy thing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Those who have daughters let us not accept Lyn Ngugi to bring such examples  for our children to see. I feel sick and tired.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine if these women were properly empowered.  I know such pretence can not be seen from them. They only want his money.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah you must be very very careful with that man. He doesn't love you and that woman has been told alot about you and that is why the woman agreed to marry him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You second woman don't waste time telling us that you like Sarah.  The womaniser has destroyed you two. Take this to the bank.
You will all remember my message. There is no man who can manage two wives equally.  The man loves murren more than Sarah. He will be having a third woman already. He has some money cheating them. Kikuyu women are very clever. He will regret."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is the trending action...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen has been married for 1.5 years which is a very short time to judge whether this marriage will servive
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are so young to have two wives. You will marry 100
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't cheat you have ruined Sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Finish such shows and go to hell.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You Lynn. Why are you showing our daughters with such bad examples.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife is cheating kenyans. She doesn't know what to do with the situation.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You came to destroy her. You should have looked  for your own husband. 
You will regret soon. You are pretending painful but it will fall out soon."
q4sWUJxjc4g,That is not a good example for our girl child.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are cheating our children.  Iam a father of 4 children and don't please cheat anybody that a man ca live in one house with two wives living in one house.
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife is prettier
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It’s Cutè because it’s only a two hour show and they have to defend and save face in this very intricate predicament but it’s NOT a sustainable setup in the world we’re living in today. Cera HAD to laugh to STOP from crying but the pain in her face is palpable. Even with children, there will always be one that feels like their sibling is loved more and that they are short changed. The 2nd wife is often humble in the beginning until she has secured her territory then the real games begin. I admire Cera a lot, without her humility, this would have been a disaster… I’m also curious about a 3rd possible wife in the future??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen haz to accept and do the maid stuff. Stop being mad in the morning . Clean the house
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I THINK THE BOY IS LIVING HIS FELICITY IN THIS LIFE, THINK ALSO OF THE LIFE TO COME, BECAUSE IT MAY BE BITTER, AN UNAXPLANABLE BITTERNESS !"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is bleeding inside😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only Swahili word I heard was maphenzi😅😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is amazing and we  have  a family  and  the other lady is amazing and focused 😢😢😢😢 Foolish man..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wacerra, you are a  gorgeous woman! Keep your head up, girl!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What happened to this family??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Total rubbish in discussion there is no life there. Abraham unanidanganya.that you love both of them. Don't stress Sarah(achosen wife from Heaven)
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good story. Thank you presenter and moderator. Abraham in the bible had two wives. Do people read the Bible upside down? Abraham is a true Pan-African. When we criticize polygamy we should remember that we're victims of British colonialism
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hell to the No!
This idiot was cheating while wife was pregnant.
Very disrespectful, when does it stop.. 
Serah is a Precious diamond any man will be lucky to have her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a story of its kind
q4sWUJxjc4g,To hell with this...i cant stand this nonsense....Cera uko na nguvu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen calling Serah Sarah is the first problem, while she insist to be called Serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my view, Abraham is a figure who commands respect for his transparency and honesty. I believe that many men find it challenging to commit to one partner, a reality that requires understanding and acceptance.
I admire Abraham’s ability to love and care for the two women. His openness with his partners paints a picture of a promising future, underscored by his evident sense of responsibility and commitment to his family.
I think that for women who may be grappling with the challenges of single motherhood, this alternative lifestyle could offer a path to stability and happiness, both for themselves and their children.
Moreover, for women seeking marriage, if finding a responsible, unmarried man proves difficult, I suggest considering the possibility of becoming a second wife to a responsible, married man. This could be an alternative path to finding the love and security you seek.
I firmly believe that every marriage and every life is unique. Life doesn’t come with rehearsals, and we navigate through it based on our circumstances, beliefs, and choices. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions, and sometimes, unconventional paths can lead to fulfilling lives.
In my opinion, the essence of a relationship lies in mutual respect, understanding, and love, regardless of its structure. Let’s continue this conversation respectfully, acknowledging the diversity of experiences and choices, and learning from each other’s unique stories."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's not possible I disagree this! There must be some evil forces behind❗❗❗God did not give Adam 2 wives  sorry😳🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men are polygamous in nature,,ladies let no one lie to you that you can satisfy a man Alone,,am proud of these two who know the reality of nature and have accepted it comfortably,,all the best for this amazing family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,2024
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham just know Serah is in pain,  she may not show you but her pain may manifest someday.
And you Maureen,  get serious! As pretty as you look,  you had to enter another woman's marriage. Imagine you were Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kizugu mingi but hii ni dhabi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy heaven mtaonea viusasa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pretence
Abraham will bring in other 10,women in the name of love is beyond loving the person, but its the feeling, so to me Abraham is still on a journey, he is just a humanizer. Abraham, all woman are you, even me i am more supportive, so you are using those women, many are coming, eeiiii."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Imagine, he is not even ashamed to publicly say he posted a picture of a daughter on his whatsapp status and quickly took it down because he did not want the side chick to know he has a family...bull"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is cow
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My Daughter will always be my pride no matter  who I meet eish!How do I hide My Mamaa,the love of my life!This guy failed as a dad!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Really, this is infedility and wrong. How dare you try to justify what is wrong. Maureen look for your own man, don't be fooled..you are committing adultery. Watch the space, this will backfire very soon. Cerah ..how dare you allow this man to walk all over you???? Nonsense"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The second woman should go! It is ridiculous. The second woman should go, look for a man. So disrespectful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's sad. Something wrong with them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I could not understand these ladies! Is it disrespectful?
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have subscribed to Abraham's channel ❤..sasa baraka ziendelee kuwa nao
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is practical.
You can love two pple ,,even both gander . A lady can honestly love two men without jealousy..same to men ... In every 10 men or women 3-4 go through that but can't show it openly to all people..Thank me later"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Where did this family go?
Its been  while they posted on their channel"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How did the white man convince us that polygamy is sin, and being gay and lesbian is perfectly okay...big up man..a man was not created for one woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham  I salute you coz huku inje kuna wenye mmoja ameshinda but u have two, mmmh to the ladies   kudos na msikue mnaficha white"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't have a problem with him having two wives,but the problem is he cheated."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Soo disgusting ! I don’t even know where cerah got the energy to come and sit for this crazy conversation about your hubby cheating on you and making it look fancy !
q4sWUJxjc4g,But only thing make 2 women close or friends they're are either planning to shut the husband for ever 6 fit under if you know what I mean....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The guy is greedy ya hiyo kitu.
One woman cannot fulfill his desires, bure Kabisa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sara is not happy,ni kujikaza tuh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Lynn, I’m a Zimbabwean who followed you from the time you were with Tuko.
I’m touched or say burdened with this story. Serah was told that “what I am about to tell you will either break us or we continue. And I feel she had no choice since she wanted her kids to grow with their father. God said two are one and not three. 
I’m sorry to say this but I pray the other wife should get her own man. She will get someone with the same situation. I’m not God so I conclude by praying for God’s will 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is totally wrong though the man is pretending like everything is ok he is going to bring another 1 again bcz a leapord will never change its sports truely speaking l hate snatchers find your own man and happiness out there
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In history,traditional community leaders,normally lived in families of more than one wife.I know the families were able to prosper and be peaceful and get to enjoy love and happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Term your eyes my brother, stop looking for any beautiful woman you see, how many are you going to get by the time you grow old, for there's a saying that says beautiful ones are no yet born, and for the other woman you will always remain the other woman as the saying goes."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Sarah..you are selfish man ..Maureen you should find another young man with no responsibility..you are beautiful woman ..Sarah had no choice..poor woman..I hope he doesn't get another one again
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this family! It is one of the best Christian families I know. A perfect model for the whole world!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Rubbish, this is not a perfect model for the world..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God has confirmed the validity of monogamy and polygamy as marriage in the Bible. Moreover, the patriarchs demonstrated in detail how marriage should be put into practice by their divinely guided lifestyle"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man married them for the financial benefit. Which is fine I guess
q4sWUJxjc4g,Opportunist man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"‭‭Matthew‬ ‭19:5‭-‬6‬ ‭NIV‬‬
[5] and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? [6] So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”

Yahwehs blueprint for marriage is monogamy.

This threesome union is not built on the solid rock - Yeshua therefore it is out of His protection."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Without being judgment, Abraham is a man with unique gifts and wisdom. I say this from the way I see how carful he answers questions in the presence of both his wives"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"CREDIT GOES TO SERAH, I MUST THANK HER MOTHER"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Come back after 10 years and tell us whether your experiment was successful

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Beautiful family as long as they are happy together who are we to judge.If you are the Mr or Mrs perfect go and find your world .This is one of the unique relationships that’s for few and not for all.God has given us the right to choose, the right to rule, right to live."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Would it be ok for Abraham if any one of the two ladies decided to bring in ""a husband""?  Too selfish.  And, It would not surprise me if he brought in another one. Not at all. He has a great art of manipulation."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The men in the bible were certainly not perfect, we are all a work in progress until Jesus returns.  But they did not go out of their way to to offend Godly principles.  When they did, they repented before God.  There were also serious consequences for their actions.  I agree with Abraham, read the whole bible - WITH UNDERSTANDING!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a christian and this is the Lords doing really?????😢....may God help us
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In this empire, who are the subjects?  I can not believe this, I can not accept or advocate for it.  There is something beyond what I am seeing.  I wonder which principle in the bible, this arrangement is following?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moderator you are  the best for bonding them more.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Afadhali hawa...98 %of us  who are commenting are hypocrites...men have sidechicks with children who are only known during burial day...women are falling in luv with married men everyday...so if this three decided to be honest and speak out...wamejaribu sana...wacha sisi mapepo tuendelee kujifanya..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen my encouragement is that be a good wife always please and God will bless you more.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"3r wife, the one who can't handle is Maureen. But Serah is a sent from Heaven."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My brother honestly you betrayed Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God comfort you Serah it's not easy. Coming from a man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is wonderful, coming from a man😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is an Angel in human nature
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is good, this family is very luck"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Whatever my contrary opinion may be, I just love these beautiful and lovely couples. 
Serah has a noble spirit and beautiful soul. Maureen is gentle and respectful.
God Bless your beautiful unions.
Peace 🕊️ to the Abrahams."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wee , wonderful it's not easy but through God everything is  possible"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eritrea by law a man as to have 4 wife's or more same for Eswatini the king as more than 8 so does Jacob Zuma in Angola a man had 78 wife's and all got along very well so love means sharing love means fulfilling god's will
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This isn’t for everyone. My Dad tried this, He did it after 20 years of marriage to my mum, naively believing it would be  this nice. I was abroad, he wrote a letter to me, painted me a fake pink picture. Later on: chaos! Our “ Maureen” had to pack and go... drama never stopped until my mum divorced 20 years of tears and pain later. Not for me . Not for me . Not for me."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even my father tried most of the time with poly it doesn't end well😢he also failed
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen should pack and leave. Unbelievable, Sin is being painted as good 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man will bring another wife, and another one, and another one. I pity serah .."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are these women happy with them selves or within themselves
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart is beating just watching this ......May God never let me go through this 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone can have a heart attack watching this. Most disgusting is how casual Abraham is.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am here rewinding and rewinding because....THE SHOCK!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen to me and you
q4sWUJxjc4g,you can have as many.. bt DON'T DARE keep them under tha same rooF🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why do people  behave  as if polygamy is starting  with this man Abraham, The friends of God were mostly  polymous men, David,Moses,Abraham etc. Our grandparents were wise enough to practice polygamy. Our fathers may have been monogamous but polygamy is solid both biblically and its our cultural heritage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Surely Cerah's smile is not the authentic smile of a happy lady.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's too soon to celebrate this setting, the man who cannot be satisfied with one wife is dangerous. So this man rewards a business partner by marrying her as a second wife. Coming to the show is trying to sanitize or gain acceptance as a polygamous man. Yul Edochie is on the same path. Let's wait for the 10th anniversary and everyone says we are happy and they can still live in the same house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poligamy is the next big thing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Our ancestors married many wives and they had peace in there families....
q4sWUJxjc4g,The faces of the women say that there is no joy in that house
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder how some people  have normalized the abnormal. I will constantly pray for my son so that he is not this confused.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are together
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is nothing abnormal. Read more about how monogamy was introduced to the world as the normative absolute to be able to build a firm worldview based on Scripture and logic. Monogamy serves the capitalist interest. It was a transition form the agrarian revolution to Industrial Revolution following the Enlightenment. Read the rabbinic interpretations of marriage, and see the perspectives on polygamy. Read the heroes of faith in the Bible and tell me one who was not polygamous. When you are done, come back and we define the term immoral…. In any case, all of us (Africans) existing today would not have been if there was no polygamy. Somewhere in our family line, each one of us came from the other family - even if you have to trace back 5-10 generations ago."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife is very uncomfortable.  She loved her husband and didn't want to let go. She should never agree with this relationship. The man is a selfish man. Typically telling lies and not coming in daily based on what was said. He prefers the 2nd wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This woman Sarah is an Angel 😇🤩. And God bless you for accepting Maureen. You are both an example to other women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Example to yourself don't drag women into this nonsense story
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To be so open , I thought you guys were Muslims. I admire your honesty and the respect you show to one another."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is weird, but I admire these ladies loving hearts."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My only question for the ladies is that will you wish same for your girls? If yes then by all means you are really enjoying this arrangement 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,When i grow up i will be like this guy 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men are funny at times Serah looks younger than the second wife! I thought infidelity mostly involves a younger lady than the wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wewe sera unakubali kushare your man how be strong and strict tinga wana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense infederity of highest order this guy is a he 🐐 anapeda kuoja oja he will marry even a third one
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy will bring them a 3rd wife 😢.so sad what Cerah is going through
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great job in conducting this interview Lynn❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lucky, wise and blessed Abraham❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Great and progressive story!  3 enlightened, intelligent and matured loving people❤. Well done, congratulations!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's nothing wrong with this as long as he can look after them both physically and financially
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy has very strong juju
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So he was very ready n willing to lose Serah in the name of keeping Maureen around...😢
I now feel for Serah at this point"
q4sWUJxjc4g,i hope Cera found the courage to leave
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No one can love 2 people at the same time,,,wacha wewe 
To one it's love to the other it might be lust or sympathy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She clarifies she's Sera but they both still call her Sarah😅😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,The kids are the ones that suffer in polygamous families
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walieda wapi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Scary stuff
q4sWUJxjc4g,And this man will still have side chicks. Its in him
q4sWUJxjc4g,this man is a narcissist...period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yul edochie come and learn how to keep two wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera you never expected a 2nd wife but he brought one, so you cannot predict the 3rd one"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera yr too calm aki may God give you more grace .. Maureen seems to be oky with everything ..but its painful to sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These people have so many compliments for each other, are they for real?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Habraham usitundanye your children will be affected by this. You dont know which men     will meet your daughter.undetstand bibically becoz you mentioned the bible .the knew testament to  came to correct this imorarity in the old testament. We have a knew covenant with God . Remember what happened to us is the cross 1:45:30 1:45:46
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wasichana hii isiwandanye poligamy never brings happiness to men people's
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is blind.what beauty was he looking for outside there yet Sera has everything including beauty of the heart!!!!😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,I respectfully disagree Serah that by the grace of God you have to accept it. Im wondering which God youre referring to?
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder if you would be so accepting if Serah brought another man home and asked you to share a home together?? Same goes for Maureen. Would you accept another woman into the marriage if you were the first wife? Abraham's deceit and his justification of what he did is astounding!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu mwanamke wa pili alikubali aje kuishi kwa nyumba ya mwanamke wa kwanza i think separate  house is the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why should you explain yourself this much?maaaaaaaan
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen and Cera look so much alike
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You should have asked Sara first to see if she wanted a co-wife before you started being romantic with Maureen.  I bet Sara wouldn't have been that accepting. Sara is in pain. One man, one wife!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sharing a husband and a house is crazy business.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God help them, I really sorry for the ladies, not in this time he is one of the dirty kind, what I would say I can’t… I hope they will wake up.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Beautiful Family,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looking at Cera, mmh she's empowering herself and will eventually go. She's too understanding to a fault. Kuna vile she's feels cheated but playing along."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It seems like Abraham did not love Maureen genuinely, she loved her because she was clean polite and calm. Otherwise if he had really loved her genuinely he wouldn't go for Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah i pity you this man doesn't love you but loves the kids if you had not given birth o my😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy should never be an option. I'm really proud of my mum for walking out knowing she had nothing outside there. It really causes trauma especially to the first wife n the kids.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How is your mum doing currently,  and you?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"​@felixekojot6741  very well by God's grace 🙏 unfortunately my dad passed away, but the other wife who destroyed their marriage died a long time ago. We still give God the glory though, for he was our dad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,​@ChristBearerFlameHeart  whatever you say...I'm glad I'm entitled to my opinion...n u r too!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are these still going strong.? Two understanding women and enterprising at the same time is a blessing in a mans life
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ssarah ni mrembo thought ndiye second wife she even looks young
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😢im sorry but he gave Sarah no alternatives 😢he made it clear to Sarah that he loves Maureen 😢so Sarah had to accept Maureen otherwise she'd loosing her husband to another woman 😢this is a mind game. That’s my two cents 😢men always plays these games. I went through this journey and hatef every bit of it. He's not even discussing the healing journey for Sardh. 😢this process is painful. Nothing is appealing for me  here, I'm sorry.  But Goodluck for them. Abraham and Maureen are happy, I am worried about Sarah's near future , cracks are coming. I'm happy for them though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a African family and its normal for those of who are negative about this your brain washed by the European culture
q4sWUJxjc4g,I will be honest this can't work with me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen should be allowed to speak
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone is suppressing her feelings
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If we look a few decades back our African traditional setting of the family is this.befor Africans embraced Christianity. Nothing wrong so long as this family is    happy , God bless them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is it possible you should be translating to English everytime local language is used,  thanks watching from Zambia"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissist
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man  Manipulated his wife..........Period!so sad for her.she is the victim in this story ,unfortunately her husband and this Maureen want her in their story.😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham he has the third one somewhere 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Difficult proposition but would you wish it for your kids?  But I think give yourselves more space ,  my greatest fear is that there will be another & another! Please get born again before u declare it as God’s doing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"EVIL EVIL EVIL ITS A SIN , SPARE OUR NEXT GENERATION"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just  love the story 😍 ❤️ 💕
q4sWUJxjc4g,"THIS IS EVIL 
SIN WILL REMAIN SIN DON'T FORCE PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN YOUR SIN"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is evil , Jesus is coming back members , God created one man for one woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Disgusting. Poverty at work. No man can love two women the same. Just want to marry. JESUS help. There is another group of women to be added on you soon,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah has really suffered and we can all tell...one day serah will open her eyes and it will really hurt the so called husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dude...what do you do for a living? Wewe ni bingwa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very sad for Cera, body language says it all. Abraham is selfish.😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, You are wrong..It is BAAAD being a 2nd wife...
Look out there, there are un married men/.
It was saad to watch your fellow woman, Sera, go through this!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If I was lean, I would interview as a wipe tears. Kudos Lynn for being this strong to handle such a tough interview
Soo sorry for Serah's Kids that they will watch this and cry as most of us are doing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man is dangerously  a smooth talker. Surprising that a young educated man can be going through this crisis at this stage if his life😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He will marry 4, 3 and 5 like Solomon"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These home wreckers, never apologetic for hurting family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Im so sorry but this man never took Cera to any restaurants   im so sad about all this but God is the author 🙏🏽 🙌🏾
q4sWUJxjc4g,He got married hurriedly and ONLY fell in love after marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In this interview, the man has mentioned the name Maureen soo many times. It is clear where his heart is.
I need therapy to overcome this😰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh yes I noticed that too .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The sarcastic laughter from the man is saddening😭

To the man,
This is unfair to Sera and unGodly.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is saddest youtube interview I have watched. I cant stop crying for Sera...
The man and the other lady will live a cursed life

To Sera, 
Please take heart and try love yourself more.
As a lady, I know this is not easy. But may God be with you as you navigate the next chapter of your life.
Seek Gods guidance on this,.., Is Tough!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am in tears for serah😪. This should not happen to any woman!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very sad for Serah. It is clear that this man does not really love you. His body language says it all. Very sad that a spouse can be thus mean..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am saddened by this. This is wrong! My heart goes out to Serah!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's because of money.  Nothing else
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I believe they are mature
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where did this couple go😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don’t know if I want to watch this all the way because I feel sorry for Sara’s heart. What woman in world would want to share their husbands. That’s one thing that’s never for sharing 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ do you  sleep in the same house knowing your husband is having the best time with another woman!!!! My God I would have a heartache. This is not okay young man. Look at him smiling like yes I got two wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is telling a lie, there's no man who can love 2 women the same way. He's so selfish n taking as objects, infact he takes women as pons. God is very much against polygamy. This is very wrong. Those who say Maureen is a destroyer, they're 105% correct. Abraham is a manipulator even in answering the questions here.why was he cheating at first instead of  being opened abt his feelings?  He's not faithful at all with both of them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Total nonsense. Cera u r great but I wish we would  open up your heart to see inside.I know you have gone through  alot with alot of cheating. Maureen nkt!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some Kenyans here just amaze me with their comments, as if polygamy is from the moon yet most of us here are from polygamous homes....Awuoro!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera has a plan, looking from her eyes she is up to something
When you hurt your woman and act all calm and patient, as a man you should think twice...cera will definitely pay back, and her plan will shock you guys
Cera i hope you succeed in your plan
I watched the entire interview and all i could tell is that the man is too much in to Maureen and Cera of course is jealous (she is human, and she has a right to).
Cera, it is okay not being okay... your eyes tells it all
I am sending hugs to cera ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Rewatching this after one yr😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,In Christian marriages only death should come between a man and his wife. Maureen is death. What a terrible title to hold.
q4sWUJxjc4g,One year later hawa wako wapi😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just because he has money, then he can have two women worshipping his behind😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly,  we need to give our girls financial stability so that they will never have to endure this man's cheating and all the nonses he is spewing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What do you mean watoto wake, are you serous, what about you and your feelings? The disrespect of it all.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Eti sikufuzi, really? Poverty and lack of financial stability for women in third world countries is the reason why men like this cheater here think they can do anything and get way with it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So, he has cheated on his wife to the point of having a whole child?  He is sitting here normalizing it. That wife of his is really not happy. You can see that all over her face."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just seeing this now after a year I wounded if it still working . This guys is just selfish and this ladies I don’t think they are real esp Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I noted Ceras introduction, I am THE wife to Abraham. That speaks volumes but maisha ni yake"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Im sure theres a 3rd person
q4sWUJxjc4g,What happened to these throuple.walinyamaza
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dont dare!! You dont have the grace our great grandparents had to cook 3 women in the same house. My twins pick on each other how about cowives. What a joke.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Lynn Ngugi , this guy anaeza kuingiza box , I think fair play to him he gets attracted to high value women I see you being third one for him wallahi 🙈 33:26 Lynn's curiosity shows she wants to learn , someone out there is watching; to be continued..........."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"C CHILD ????? U CANT MANAGE. CHILDREN ALREADY SUFFERING... MOOVE.. SELFISH...MOOOVE
IF ONLY  u had initially  state yr LIFESTYLE !!!. JUST WAIT... CHILDREN SUFFER SO MUCH BECAUSE OF PARENTS SELFISHNESS... SHORT PLEASURES.. OH THE CHILDREN IN THESE SITUATIONS"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sombody....LEAVE,  MOVE, LEAVE MOVE"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Meeting CRUCIAL for U.. FOR U U U!!?? GO GET A 3RD, 4TH AND A5TH. UNDER SAME PROCESS... THE CHILDREN  .. .LATET ON...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera .. u r TRAPPED... GOT RID OF YOUR INDEPENDENCE.... YR FATHER: I HAD BETTER HOPES FOR U.... C? ..C??!!!! HOW CAN U WALK AWAY CERA???  TIME WILL TELL, ONLY TIME...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,SELFISH..... TIME WILL TELL
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ther eis nothing new here. Most of us were born in polygamous homes. My mother was a the thrid wife to my father though she found him single without those women. We had good lives and the family is still together. It depends on the women in the relationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not resonating. Many questions run through the mind. Sharing friendship 💕 yes, but sexual partners?.........infidelity has only one definition."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This handsome men nisumbua
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that this two women have decided to unite in uncomfortable piece of arrangement… it’s so unfortunate for this foolish man… From the beginning of creation.. it’s true that to manage one woman, Eve ,  who’s was first wife to Adam and the mother of human race was difficult… God kicked  her out of the garden due to rebellion accepting satan. Deal this new two woman are just there for time being .. same thing happened to both women it will happen again to another man… I hope this fool doesn’t get caught up in the  monster that he has just created by his own lies of love corruption … this is doomed… you can see it in his first wife reaction… a real man has one heart and loves now woman 💯 % he will end up despising one and love one with time because he’s just human being and weak one.. them two women united for just for survival reasons not ❤️ I am just saying! Soothing words 😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am from a polygamous  home  with more than two mothers i have  never seen them fight till i got  married virtually  all doing well and we care about each others, may be because we are muslims been real"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women in the comment section are bitter and your men are out here cheating😅😅😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,My   God   guide  your   union   in   jesus   mighty   name
q4sWUJxjc4g,His  name  follow  him  in  the   bible
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As much as i love this our lovely siz lyn show ya leo ni kali ,lakini cera not happy at all by thw body language 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can never be me
q4sWUJxjc4g,What happened to this couple...... LNS walete tena
q4sWUJxjc4g,father abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is not comfortable at all.The facial expressions can tell
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support polygamy at all..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let us all keep this family in God's hand's..no one can love 2 wife's at the same time..a big lie to who calls himself Abraham..
q4sWUJxjc4g,No
q4sWUJxjc4g,They don’t have a choice  but to be happy that not love
q4sWUJxjc4g,To me this is a big Noooo!!!!so it means this Abraham akipata mwinge tena atapita na yeye 🤔🤔 I can't advice anygirl to enter another womans marriage 😢😢😢 Noooo
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish you could follow up with this family. Are they still together and happy as they said
q4sWUJxjc4g,I sat today to watch this one and i have been postponing. I will say it here.. clearly they are trying to prove they are happy . Maureen is clearly lieing.. they want to clear themselves.. i feel bad for Sarah.. from her smile you can see pain. May God give her strength. Polygamy is not a thing to entertain.. aka erî ni nyungu ya urogi..  mûgîkuyu nîaugire.. it's either one of the ladies is bisexual or is unhappy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Of course if he meets another browner one than these two, he gonna bring her home as a third wife"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata I think things are not okey
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Now he may feel its ok to have a 3rd wife,then after a 4th.
Sarah got to be a strong woman. I dont want to say what I would have done,had I been Sarah. 
Abraham, seems to be a lovable person,but he's dishonest and has allowed his loins to rule his head! Disgusting , as for Maureen, hn. She fell in love and pretended that she didnt love,but the temptation had the better of her. She allowed her loneliness to get the better of her.
I wish at times to share in the whole story,so much non english,I  was lost."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sorry for Cera. Young girls empower your selves with education, word of God and the your own resources. This Hagar needs to walk away from Cera's husband and family. Walk away Hager."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham  had 2 wives. LEAVE THIS GUY ALONE.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only redeeming thing is that A told S that he wud one day marry a 2nd wife....may God help him not to be sick or broke in future or he dies ahead of them.....because the 2nd wife often goes for a form of witchcraft to get more love and control the man....the first wife then goes to church.....no wonder the man dies first not considering the struggle to provide for the huge family.....because or the women compete to have as many kids as possible....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's no peace in polygmy, even if you have  money. There is always competition, hatred and compromise among the wives and children that at times lead to witchcraft. Let us not lie that's just an act for cameras."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So guys, did you plan on being in black trousers and white shoes?????????????😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This was painful to watch
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii maisha ukiwa hauna options....options zinakuplania
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah anakaa wale wasichana shuleni walikuwa zubaaa zube zube......na hivyo bwana akaenda na akamletea mwenzake....why unazubaaa tu unanyamaza tu.....fight for your family.....otherwise the Devil will see thrilling families and do his things....so wee kaa kazi yako ni kukasirika as ovyo ....utaacha hivyo....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah gave up on the fact that alishindwa kuanza tena....even factors like aibu kwa wazazi wake or woga and she had no confidence to move out...aache pesa ....huyu mwingine was like this man we build this wealth together ....both of them from facial expressions are not comfortable....remove money and see true colors
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The calmness of cera is scary,hapo siwezi kaa mimi."
q4sWUJxjc4g,😢moreen is not even beautiful like cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, this is not your husband. Better run for your life and lieave Cerah alone. Ceral cong for passing thru all this and atill there strong"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah lives her husband, her husband loves Maureen. 
Husband should train himself to talk lovely about Cerah too.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is disgusting
q4sWUJxjc4g,What does God say about the sanctity of marriage lets not sugar coat because thats the devil's gymic am smelling selfishness Bwana Abraham but as you say worse is happening out here but that does not mean you make your setting seem right when you know very well you have chosen to disobey God you dont ice evil and preach it
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was born and raised in a polygamous family...my mothers lived in the same house. We are friends as children and our father was loving. Abraham please love them without partiality and they will respect you. I pray that God will bless your family.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you're well organized❤  Serah & Maureen just keep respecting each other, don't mind some stupid comments ooo! we're losing men everyday due to the foolish conflicts going on around the world currently"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kindly use English language during your interview  so that we all understand the story 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,CERA is wise and amazing. She feels to me like the one who subtly manifested this. Congrats to all of them and best of luck.
q4sWUJxjc4g,more power and love to you all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow the conditions he gave after Cerah confronted him;..Wow like WOW. He clearly stated his boundaries and Cerah had no boundaries so she had to accept else their relationship ends. It's so good to always know your worth,values and what you deserve. I HAVE ALOT OF WORK TO DO WITH MY DAUGHTER.Hugs to Cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love fades if it's fake it will fade just a matter of time
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True!
Please teach your daughter better."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, but not in one house or one kitchen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is not something to be happy for,NEVER!Trauma for the kids"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@LynnNgugi update please 🎉🎉
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a narcissist...So there are policies of ,""do not touch my phone,respect my privacy"" but he went and slept outside and had a whole baby..that's where he draws a very thick line"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How would they (men) like it if a Women can have 2 Husbands?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah has so.e psim that shehides
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy was  never  the  original  plan  of  God  ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man anakaa kuwa na  d....ck ndogo i wonder how he's  satisfying  them maybe  pesa tu sura zero
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That man is unfaithful and he is an opportunist! Looking beyond love to be able to get a second wife, 3rd or even 4th…. You are a player."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ob God, Cera my heart goes to you because you look like you have sacrificed your happiness to just gain peace in your home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is a lie 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is toxic so much praises for maureen, does cerah have parents? if they are watching mmmmmm"
q4sWUJxjc4g,the husband is happy after having two wives now he wears ironed sox. cerah leave
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah is very clever
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife comes with blessings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah says abraham spoke so highly about maureen...i think cerah came to a boiling point and accepted maureen in her life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,there are so much lies in maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The husband talks about loving maureen so much. even the way cerah looks at abraham, there is so much pain and she feel being cheated on."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The comments from the husband that maureen is polite , shows the husband looked for traits in maureen that cerah didnt poses. cerah should have moved on with her life.. The husband is a player who lookes for money from women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,one day lynn will be interviewing cerah alone. There is so much pain the eyes and and in the smile.
q4sWUJxjc4g,1:45:37 I've never been lucky in life!!! Not easy to say those words
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just came across this video and wuueh!!! The way he keeps on insisting to Maureen, ""You know what you mean to this family""....like what would she mean? Serah didn't ask for this ....she deserves better than this...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,We live by pretending
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a devil worshiper,he bewitched these ladies"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham, had many sons...

Mlidhani atatoa hao many sons wapi? 😂😂😂

But if the first wife is comfortable who are we to complain na kiatu haiko kwa miguu yetu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is this family alright,  been a while since they post to their YouTube"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just bring us Akothee because she’s natural
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just sugar coating. It is so uncomfortable and conditional, yet confusing. These are confused confused, disorganization the organized."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wife number 3 should be brought on board
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂that's our guy ...we are beginning good conversations as a country
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well, I think this marriage set up is a pretty good one! They all seem to be getting along well and hopefully that keeps on going for a long time. This union also seems to keep the fire going in the bedroom matters for the guy especially when the other partner is biologically down. The dude also got a hard working new lady to compliment the efforts of the first wife. Every man should like and appreciate this kind of love setting as long as the two ladies are getting along fine! It’s what it is so the public should mind their own business and let this union be!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks younger considering she is a mom of three..m
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is a strong woman.  I cant fit in her shoes
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is hard on Sarah, I hope she is just not settling because she feels trapped.  Maureen I find her naive and easily manipulated."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This ladies look alike
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't even have the strength to listen to this interview.  I already feel the pain cerah has. Men are heartless. Why do people act like its ok yet it clearly isn't 😢😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy can never be  normal. Only selfish men will engage in it and it will leave women damaged. Such women refuse to accept that it's not good for them.  Why would a woman cling onto a man who doesn't love her???
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uganda ❤ loves your shows Lynn.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I see is that you Abraham the day you start betrayal cera god will paid with out even waist time cera is your blessing always make sure cera is happy that is only advice
q4sWUJxjc4g,But cerah is having that pain of sharing a man inside her heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,My husband wanted to bring me this nosense life I told him never and never only over my death body. So covid came and killed him and I said let me move on with my life some men are very no sense they don’t know even what they want
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ilove the fact that they speak fluent eng.focussed.minding there business and love of the family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham will strike again in the future. He has a wondering eye. Sarah is very, very beautiful. How can he do that to her?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Interesting story,  wow. Only grace can do this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I guess most of men have polygamous nature, making their life easy by accepting it might make your life easy ( like Cera's acceptance of reality). I believe the ladies can possibly co-exit peacefully and joyfully. But they need to pursue the same grace that brought them together continually...❤🎉"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Really I feel so happy for u guys especially who can manage those two ladies. May u shine always
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeuh! Is there an update?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yaani am feeling bitter 😢😢when am watching this video serah is not okay she is not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Hi guys I love what I am seeing the kind of respect and humility I so wish many of our families would learn from your wisdom words and develop good relationships like you amazing people who does not take family as a battlefield but a place where peace and prosperity must prevails and ensure that by being husband and wife means that they should focus in good planning about our children which eventually manifest themselves to the blessings and happiness of our future generations I thank you guys for all your endeavors may Mfeka gods bless you abundantly Amen 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
q4sWUJxjc4g,The intruder of the first love should walk out pls...  No no. One will have to walk away in the near future. Sorry for the young man for he doesn't understand the reputations.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii familia ilienda wapi?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn tutafutie hawa watu,walienda wapi?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So you and cerah are an open book yet you dont touch each others phone. Doesnt add up. Just like you loved maureen with cerah already in picture, you will love another and another, beautiful girls and well-mannered are still being borne., Cerah whatever is holding you back dont be a sugar cookie, life can be unfair, face the bullies and move on, you are sitting on a ticking time bomb."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where are they now.????
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ask Demathew wives what happened after even after them coming live acting all well hakuna kitu iko hapa
q4sWUJxjc4g,How is Cerah now😢😢 juu WTH is this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A baby you made while married Abraham.  You not breaking this, he said.  Wow."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First love is the love
q4sWUJxjc4g,What i can say is if they are okay am okay and good luck to them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ooh my poor Sarah-from all i hv gathered -from expressions to evrything-Sarah you are not loved.You are jus kept for the purpose of not breaking your heart but you are not the real 1for this marriage.Thx Lyn-the manner you arange your quaestions exposes the truth on who is truely loved here
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mr polygamous -you are very selfish and may the same thorn return 10 times in your flesh 1 day.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thanks A lot LYNN ngugi God bless Abraham’s family,can you meet my pastor on the same ,we believe polygamy because it is HOLY MARRIAGE from GOD"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the best arrangement for the sake of everyone. Children hate their fathers because of the way mothers react to such situations. That girl Pendo asking her dad tough questions, dad needed in both homes, it can lead to breakdown of everyone. Cerah invited the Holy spirit in her house, as a wise woman. What i observe is both women are very brainy, empowered, one xtra thing cerah has is the wisdom of God. As for Moreeen she is a good student of cerah, and kinda she was brought up well."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I understand Cerah so...much...she loves herself so..much. Nimemaliza
q4sWUJxjc4g,What is this?!😱😱😱😱🙊🙊🙊
q4sWUJxjc4g,I understand Sarah....she decided to love herself. Thats the bottom line - if you love a person more than you love yourself...hehehe...my dear ladies...utaishi na blood pressure....ama uende jail. Wisdom is important.
q4sWUJxjc4g,These are 2 amazing ladies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kuna watu wamejam hapa...lakini maisha si yenu inawauma na Nini?... Mungu bariki hii familia siku Moja pia Mimi nitakubaliwa na mwenzangu...
q4sWUJxjc4g,I got no words men! Two women in same roof?How is this even possible in 21st century?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let them be, who are we to judge."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Looking for the next interview when the two girls will speak more than the gent.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He cheated on Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is wrong.. even cerah shows that she is hurt 😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,From the carbbean or culture it different god bless Serra .
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not good for serah she should walk out of this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Trauma. Narcissism. Self- love. Virtue signaling. Choice. 

Serah- I would recommend that you seek therapy immediately, especially on dealing with repressed emotions. This man lied to you, and had a baby outside the sanctity of your marriage. This  can never be easy. This was difficult to watch. Was Serah goaded into this? Did she feel that she had no choice? Self- love. 

Serah- what do you truly want? Not the man, not the second lady. Just you. What do you truly want?

Interestingly, the man quickly circumvented the question regarding his childhood. This is super important. Tell me the narrative regarding your childhood, and this begins to shed light on trauma, and the underlying choices and actions behind this man. 

Another fascinating facet was he mentioned that he was attracted to both women’s work ethics. He never mentioned physical attraction. “Oh Serah please stay. Please stay.”

Let’s revisit this conversation 5 years from now, and focus the interview questions on the man’s childhood experiences. 

Self love. Self love. Self love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The problem with our society is that, ""they accept lies far better than the truth,"" and Moureen is been thrown stones alot because Abraham decided to make her known publically and our society doesn't want that...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woow, this family is awesome. I pray that God keeps you together harmoniously to eternity 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa jamaa asikuwe soo comfortables..first wife bado hajaheal
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah your facial expressions show that you are still healing deep inside I pray that you May find happiness❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I believe there are some infos she is just hearing about now, and she is trying to process and you can tell her heart is broken 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How can you do that to SERA, this man is weekend."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is weekend indeed🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weekendoooo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lucky man😂, unlucky ladies"
q4sWUJxjc4g,From what i know is we have no reasons to replace someone in our lives and we already have those peoples we love.i feel like this man marry cera because at first he saw how hardworking she was...coming to Maureen he fell in love with her and there was no anyother way to take her out of his life seens she was already pregnant.u cant replace me while am alive and claim u love me how can u share one heart to 2 people.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is a bit hard to believe that Cera is happy about the situation. 
This interview looks like it is to help Maureen's public image.when Cera first asked him about Maureen, he said he loved Maureen and was not prepared to lose her. He did not reassure Cera that he  still loved her. He just reassured Cera that he did not intend to send her home or stop taking care of her and the kids. Cera loves Abraham, but does Abraham love Cera or for him she is beyond love?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, your both wives are more  respectful to one another and are at peaceful mind set, God bless you all, Greetings from Papua New Guinea 🇵🇬"
q4sWUJxjc4g,much can be said bt 2 those whom blv in God.what is God will consernig marrige?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow what a beautiful family 👪 🎉 😊😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,LEGENDARY
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do it your way guys.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah....you are still young. May you find true love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walienda wapi tena 😁
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you are equated to death according to the bible
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂 this is their 😂just came to Uganda 🇺🇬 my mom land a man married 7 ladies and 2 of them are sisters men work hard bse if u have same money every thing is possible 😂😂😂😂 congratulations 👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah may you heal from all this in Jesus name.moreen you are a home breaker.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I  dont advocate polygamy at all 
Never ever  to say you are ok is a big lie deep down the loves one than the other"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow.What a  happy unique family.Zera a woman of integrity congrats.The man of  house  ur worthwhile. The moderator ur fantastic mature quiz n opinions.I have enjoyed ur show😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this show
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also want to marry another wife, but they will be separate. Hii wanajidanganya"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii nguvu sina mimi😆😆😆nimejikubali na nikajitambua.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah you have a heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great family May God grant you all more love❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,I grew up in polygamy and I see it as a game. I don't like it aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How is tgis family now? If i was serah all the free time i would get ,i qould be on my knees,qhen abraham goes to maureen that night i cant sleep,i spend my night praying and crying to God and one day God answers prayers"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At the foundation of your marriage is respect???? 😮😮 . Please let it be God, and your eyes will open."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Feels and looks unnatural
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lol these comments are wild. I am happy for them. I’ve experienced poly from being cheated on in one relationship and I’ve experienced it in another relationship where we both were aware of each other. I loved having a sisterwife. The relationship ended because of differences between he and I but till this day I still miss the sisterhood I had with her. It’s possible and it’s a beautiful thing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A man is perfectly capable of loving more than one woman at a time, something no woman can understand

Women simply just need to accept men for who and what they are instead of what a woman wishes him to be 👍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shame on you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful cera sending ❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy got tired of his first wife  period! Why a whole interview to explain the obvious
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where did these people go?their channel is dormant
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am watching this today and am just happy of them ❤❤❤❤
Cerah ❤❤❤❤❤gem"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Asanteni Abraham, sera, and moreen. Tuko wengi na twafurahia na familia zetu, Mimi, wewe, sakaja bullfighter, Atwoli, list ni kubwa, and we are a happy family.
Hao monogamous wanatuona the other way round infact wengi hawana amani kwao. If you are able to manage polygamy well, go for it, if you feel monogamy ndio poa kwako practice that and be responsible. It's that simple."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am here today watching this beautiful 🥰 episode ❤❤❤❤
Cerah is 💯💯💯❤❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham , Sarah, Haggai,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🦅🇰🇪🇺🇸…🦅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aii this is a fake smile in cera's face..if it is living in different houses we can understand but this one is a nooo..this man is selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A Narc, it’s always by your rules nkt!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Too many bitter lonely women in this comment section presume Sarah is not happy. It works for a traditional man who understands ALL  his roles.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have not finished to watch this interview but l will tell you Maureen
Leave ceras marriage. No matter how whole three want to make it look okay God's word is the standard of living. Cera it is a sin to accept a sin. Abraham it is called adultery before God's eyes. Maureen you are still young and beautiful. If you will leave this marriage and leave your child to cera go your way and watch God bless you in dimensions not seen before but if you continue to stay in that marriage you God's  wrath shall continue to be on your head. For women out there, pray this prayer my husband shall drink from his own cistern he shall recognize any other woman as strange."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Whatever the two women feel ni hao tu wanajua...wish u well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera...you said in your life you are not lucky, that Abraham is your only lucky thing. But I want to tell you that luck has little to do with how happy or successful we are in life. You have a very strong personality. People mistake calmness for weakness...there is nothing weak about you. You have been purposeful and intentional. You have kept your husband's honour, you have fought for your family. I think both Maureen and Abraham acknowledge this about you...without you this would be two households and now it is a family. I wish you all the best in your family. May God honour your commitment and water the garden of your labour. After all ... Scripture says that a wise woman builds her home with her own hands. God bless your hands and make them strong."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a calm lady Cerah is.girl you are strong .personally i wont be able to tolerate such
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Shuuu. You does that ? We are not Christians ? At one point, Abraham is a good father, majority Kenyan men are hiding children and it is a”sin”"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hahaha eti not a destroyer that's how the bible calls you aki ts bad to pin pain in someone's life Cerah not happy aki she is faking
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope the girls get together and ditch this dude . He is not worth it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for the kids! What will you tell them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaaaaaiiiiii I don’t agree with this kind of setting. It seems 2 people are happy and one is not.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope one day Cera will heal and tell her story her facial expressions talks Louder than her voice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its better to have two wives than being lied that u are the only one yet he has 3 side chicks mungu alijuwa mwanaume hawezi tosheka na mmoja ...and Quran and bible allows man to marry mo than one hii ya mke mmoja ni mzungu alileta ata mababu zetu walikuwa na zaidi ya mmoja
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No way you can feel 100% comfortable in this situation,,,,,kwani una roho ya chuma"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some comments though...whatever the angle you guys wanna view it, they live together n they are happy unlike most of you who owns their husbands yet you still love miserable marriage lives"
q4sWUJxjc4g,cera your humility can do many things God be with you cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For some reason I feel like Maureen will eventually leave. I see she is not making eye contact with Abraham as much Cera does. 

To Abraham: God is God and He can do as He pleases. Don’t go against Him because you think that He should be fair in allowing you to do it because He used others who did."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"So the tide is changing,,,polygamy is bad but gayism is not......stupidity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So  many  people here are trolling this family for practicing polygamy....and also saying LGBTQ is not bad???? Ati love is love,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sister wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ni me pekee naona the 2 Mrs. Abrahams wanafanana kiplani or? He might have a type btw.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The president of Tanzania is a third wife. Polygamy is very okay and healthy. Dont let western world lie to you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After 44 mins, am done with this. Selfish man. Weak women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well done..👏👏this is the natural order of things!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,One or both of these ladies are not happy. Only one person is guaranteed to be happy.... This guy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Tabia za wahuni, A very proud selfish individual who doesn't care about the feelings of the partner. Malipo ni papa hapa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,An error is an error no matter how much you try to paint it.if it didn't work for Abraham of the Bible... Ishmael will never be Isaac no matter what! The Dust is still on...Wait when the Dust settles....Who can't see and read Sarah's heart? Who can't see the attention you are giving to Maureen?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow what a beautiful family
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very soon he's adding another mmcchhwee
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't watch this to the end, it's sickening"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah we love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah we love you and you are tge hero
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bull***
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is just accomodating he husband a second wife for her own sake  and children.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The worst episode 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man actually looks wicked, proud and take advantange of women interest."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"lynn please do the same interview with this family 5 years later and it will shock you, remember demethew two wifes?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly I heard they r fighting over their late husband's property
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@sheilaokila5579 the husband is already gone🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone  said marrying  two wives  is like signing  for a death  sentence ​@sheilaokila5579
q4sWUJxjc4g,Time ticking bomb..this Maureen thing is a good example of slay queens prying on pples marriages..devil😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is a narrrrcccciiiiiiiisssstttttt😢..Cerah RUN
q4sWUJxjc4g,8yrs in marriage..n from nowhere you bring a Maureen of one year
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just imagine  cerah 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️
q4sWUJxjc4g,How many times has this guy said Maureen???
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Maureen thing is not thinking....😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm seeing a very opportunistic guy n one innocent vulnerable lady n another bed hoper,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Afro cinema 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not Me!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mbaaaaa......how do these kids growup😮😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,AB remember the world is watching via satilite (swiss)
q4sWUJxjc4g,Infact don't know what to say cos my situation was different my father has 4 we fighting all day till now no peace in my home  AB just try to organize ur family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is an African thing
Nothing serious here
All i see are happy pple
Stop forcing sadness on cerah bc she doesn't look it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder how Maureen would react if she were wearing  Cerah's shoe?   Will Abraham add another beautiful woman  and baby to his family?
q4sWUJxjc4g,He already had another baby with a lady called Milly.. someone said that. The person knows the Ibra of a thing.. clearly he is a womaniser and can't change
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is very loving man,  that is why he was able to achieve this without any ranchor. But for Sarah she is just a good girl though it was difficult.  Arine also is a good girl. It has happened you can't help it. Wish you God protection and Peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel Maureen held this family hostage, depending on this man body language seems she has a big say in their business, so it will break the business in case she leaves the guy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,U cannot  serve two Master at the same time.  U will either hate the one and love the other.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yenyewe there's power in the name. Abraham, father Abraham!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Love them , they living there Best Life
Honesty@ Respect"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii kitu iko sana ni vile tu imewekwa siri na wengine heri tu kutokezea, you be in the light than being in darkness atleast she knows about moureen and she is heeling....,,,mungu asaidie serah coz she is the pillar and she experiences the most pain."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is beautiful lady❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,A second wife is a destroyer . No justification.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is so cute
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine and the guy still added another woman to their life's 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Been wondering where they went-we would like to have an update follow-up.
@@JulietPritt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a covert narcissist though it's very easy to miss. I see right through him! His line of thought, body language, selfishness etc tell it all.

Serah is an empath, and this typically happens to empaths.

Maureen is a silent killer, a home wrecker. Why was she having coffee with a married man after she found out Serah exists?? 

In many African polygamous marriages one wife kills another and many times witchcraft is involved and the other wife sadly passes on through sickness or sudden death. I won't be surprised if that happens here. Maureen is not an honest woman. 

This whole arrangement will not end well unfortunately,  even if it take decades to crumble. Sin is sin and Abraham you will reap what you have sown. You quote the Bible and only pick what justifies your sinful marriage but God cannot be mocked. I feel sorry for the children. They bear the brunt unfortunately."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope cerah one day finds her feet and realise her worth and leave Abraham to be the narcissist that he is 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serha is not stupid she know what she's  doing very calculating clever
q4sWUJxjc4g,Husband is a smooth operator serah is very humble she's the glue and her husband knows this probably takes advantage of that ad for the other wife I don't know but it their life
q4sWUJxjc4g,That is crazy.God created one man for one woman . Not that mess. They need prayers.I will pray for them .Amen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is better alete kuliko mipango  huku nje it hurts deep
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a time ticking bomb, may my girl never find herself in this situation."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm seeing it ..I hope Sarah finds herself
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Maureen was cera could you accept cera??? I can't share a man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think the only problem with this guy is keeping the 2 wives under the same roof.
It's not prudent because it's in human nature to always disagree sometimes and that time will always come."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only winner is the man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You shared 1 husband...No apology to  make. Except in the kingdom of God trough Christ  it called adultery. And the Bible says no adulterers will inherit the kingdom of God. Now is it worth it?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some one to update me which tribe are they??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Symbiotic relationship
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah has had it rough in her life.She has been conditioned to think that she does not deserve any good.
Abraham is a NARCISSIST.A big one ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Infidelity can't be justified in Christian setup but as all parties agree on customary set up expect polygamy and its ok as long as all parties are happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi siwezi ghai wivu nikonayo ni mungu aniokoe.
q4sWUJxjc4g,serah you are beautiful.....hugs mummy.... Abraham you are a betrayer. maureen what you did was wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Following from USA 🇺🇸.  Nini Maureen ako nayo Cera hana? Shame on you Abraham!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you are just a thief, husband snatcher, shame on you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham and Maurine, you caused Serah great pain. May God deal with you! Don't lie that you are happy,  NEVER!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaah...big up to serah❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me siwezi.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Side cheaks donk care about the wife,!they use this tactic of asking about the wife and the family to make the man think they care.These people have no boundaries,you can not have coffee with a married man time and time again and think its ok."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeee! Nway works for them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu mwanaume ni mang'aa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! Soon you'll get old alot faster and have no energy to stand up bro. Today you showed a man that is greedy of control who thinks he can have it all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mmh, it's been a while since they uploaded on their channel..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Go check de marthews story

I wanted to hear Lynn's questions but man I didnt want to hear the man speak... I don't believe  you can love two people . perhaps sexually attracted but not love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Have the ladies cross visited each other's maiden homes?
q4sWUJxjc4g,@lynn where did these couples go to? They don't even do their vlogs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can see how Lynn is feeling for Ceraah, I feel for her too, am not so strong to stand such a betrayal.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's possible Abraham will get a 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't believe in polygamy.   No man can serve 2 masters.  It's just natural .  What if the wife decided to take another husband?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Funny how a great percentile of comments are monogamy centered. The west got us.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing justifies infidelity,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Someone in this interview is not comfortable and it’s obvious this is why sticking to God’s design and original plan is important. We must understand that just because alterations and deviations are shown to us in the Bible through stories of men such as Sampson Solomon, David we are also shown the incredible grief and anguish they suffered because of the choices they made. God didn’t make Adam, Eve and Sarah for Adam he made one woman. God’s original intention was for one man and one woman."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Fake husband! Fake second wife!!!! KARMA IS REAL! This man will go for the third wife and will hurt the second wife just like  he did to Cerah. Cerah will heal with time by God’s grace, but the second wife aka husband’s snatcher talks way too much! She needs to keep quiet and be ashamed of herself! She has to repent from her sins before she can find true  happiness on this earth. This narcissistic man does not love the beautiful queen Cerah. He said that he is attracted to light skin women with heels, let him come and meet me here and I will  show him pepper and he will never go close to any light skin woman in his entire life!😂😂😂😂His laughter and that of his second wife disgust me!!!!!! LYNN YOU ARE A PRO with great communication skills! ❤"

One.sera good woman who people can take her goodness for weakness 
2 Morrie not a very good human self-centered person who cant accept coming in someone marriage was bad 3 she lied she did not know he was married she knew but she was hoping sare would walk out and have Abraham for herself.  
Abraham  selfish man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is excited to be a part of the drama because he thinks it makes him a ""ladies man"". He almost seems disappointed whenever he talks about how the two would not fight. And he's so happy and excited to talk about the drama happening in his family. He is also using his kids as a way to keep these women with him. By pretending that he can ""never let his kids go"" what he actually  wants to achieve is never letting these ladies leave him, by holding the kids over them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In short, this guy had no intention of settling down but after he saw how convenient it is to have a woman in the house, he snatched Cera up and then went ahead with seeing other women. The moral of the story is - ladies, let's stay taliban. You are a guest in his house. Wife duties on a girlfriend budget is a scam. Be very afraid that you will meet someone that you see as a husband but sees you as a helper."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not possible the 1st wife is dying slowly its a pain that no one can ever understand, i was married to a man who cheated on me and had a child with another woman apparently this lady knew his home and went to stay there, i found out when i was 7month pregnant with my child. After having my baby i had to gather myself and moved out of that toxic marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kudos to you, you are so strong and you know your worth❤,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I see here has nothing to do with love nor intimacy. In a nutshell there is no family there but business multiplication. Business! Business in every sentence. Guys you are a company not a marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kindly contact samidoh to level the family,there will be no much drama"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Never and never can one love two people equally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pretenders
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah was just conered and had nothing else to do but to accept since she either loved him or loved a family or both.She is very bitter I can tell.....time will tell
q4sWUJxjc4g,What's this?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN DO ANYTHING. THE WORLD IS FULL OF GREED, LUST,  LOVE OF WORLDLY PRIDE AND SELFISHNESS..... HOWEVER, IN THE BEGINNING WITH GOD THE AUTHOR OF MARRIAGE IT WAS NOT SO.  OUTSIDE GOD THERE IS ALL KINDS OF IMMORALITY, INCLUDING POLYGAMOUS LIFESTYLES.  SUPPOSING CERAH INTRODUCED ANOTHER MAN INTO THIS UNION TO HELP ABRAHAM UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS TO HAVE A RIVAL IN A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.  OR SIMPLY DO A PRANK WHERE YOU FAKE THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE WIVES THEN YOU WILL KNOW TRUE PURE FEELINGS OF WHAT GOD INTENDS FOR A MARRIAGE UNION. THIS ONE IS QUITE DISTURBING, OUT OF ORDER ......."
q4sWUJxjc4g,why does he keeps cutting cera off let her talk her side of the story lyn should have asked if he apologised for cheating on cera did he take accountability
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can you add Lynn as 3rd wife please?
q4sWUJxjc4g,But this guy is selfish my prayer is that your children don't emulate this. Sarah u have a very good heart may God bless u.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow that's amazing story ( testimony)❤💕✌
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I actually thought Cera was the second wife becouse she soo young and beautiful 🥰 such an innocent, lovely soul manipulated inorder to keep her marriage! God did not remove two ribs from Adam! Just One..that's why even David only ended up with One who is the mother of Solomon!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All in all, Serah looks younger than the other one. Did he got married to abit older woman as a second wife?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Seraha kazuri kweli..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mhh!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor cera😢  you are a good woman 🥰 God bless and protect you and your kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pity you Sarah.A selfish man and a beautiful woman who doesn't know her worth.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God took only one rib from Adam, not two, to form one woman... every man has his rib just as God ordianed it... there is no such thing as women are more than men , so polygamy is not okay no matter what"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just wait for the day GOD will tell Abraham to send away Hagar,read your Bible well ooh. May the LORD keep you joyful serah"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Can sera have 5minutes without interuption?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yaaasss lyn when you asked how about love, i still love you...he haf no right being defensive when she comfronted him, he was not honest from the beginning,  he was just am ass from the start. He sounds like one even now"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Am trying to vibe you...your pushing me away"" the guts to act like your making someone a favour..ill wahatever whatever to this...keep it moving"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why is Sarah letting him feel like he such a perfect person, did he take you for the bride price. He make it seem that all was  perfect he was cheating, the first wife didn’t have any choice in the matter you can see betrayal in her eyes 😢😮😮😤."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why use God name in this mess. That’s greed what you mean to look beyond loved I just say how  I feel. Don’t Judge my comments you put yourself out there like Judge Judy said. Have you see the four wives they not together anymore because it going to be some misunderstanding don’t care how perfect this seem an the surface. 
The same things those wives was saying before they all fed up and left. Sooner or later he going to get a third wife when feel like he want another."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"The door that this family has opened will affect their generation,the enemy is trying to show the society that polygamy is good and it works,the Bible is clear about polygamy,it is a sin. I wish they knew what they are doing to their children,if this door is not closed the children will end up in same kind of marriages,they may never be happy like their parents seem."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am glad Cera accepted, but why is it that husband and Maureen are speaking for her?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see a third wife. Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera receive my love and warm huge
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Run Awa y cerra you deserve better than t’hospitalisa cheatter .
And for thé second wife you havé no shame"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These hypocritical bursts of laughter  won't last long, this guy will bring other women. This is a  scenario of lust and betrayal."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That's pretense, no one I said no one would wish to share a spouse!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure NONSENSE!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"-Abraham: As you make your bed so you should lie on it. It is not possible to love two human beings with equal love. For you to get another wife, there must be something you missed in first wife. Now all that is water under the bridge so accept it and move on.
- First wife: Congrats for accepting the reality that there was another wife. You can deny as much as you can that you were okay with having a co-wife but the reality is that no one likes to have a competitor. Pack your troubles and smile and look at future with confidence. What seems to be a calamity is an opportunity facing upside down.
- Second wife: From your body language, you look a good person. You are also not comfortable with the interview and there is  guilt written in you. We can accuse you of messing someone's relationship but let the one who has never sinned be the first to throw stones at you. 
@ the whole family: Life is for a living and has ups and downs. Make the relationship work and may God bless you all. What matters is happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s bad to give a man your space. Sarah is pained from what I see.  Yu can see she isn’t talking much. I think it’s better for her to walkout.
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife hakuna na choice. Hakuwa na kwa kwenda. Hakuwa na la kufanya. She got no money. So aliamua kukaa alee watoto. Am sure if she had money am sure she wouldn't be in this marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,Invite the late dematthew queens and you will know there is pretence here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,For real I don't advocate for this I will lie if I say yes...cerah may  you keep on to get strength to over come all that..me no no no
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Maureen has blindfolded Cera. Cera wake up from that big dream. No woman does that. Stop pretending everything is okay and is clear Maureen is more loved than you. Changamka nimeboeka na huyo Maureen sana.She should look for her own hubby. The first wife is the one recognized. My opinion ooh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why not straight  English
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a man , having two wives is what I  wish for  but these wife materials of maureen and  Serah who can easily cohabit it will take me decades to get.  Big up broh  Abraham u have rearly inspired me.  Thanx Lynn for the wonderful talk."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu mubaba kifisi
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a pity😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen my dear, go look for your husband 😅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is it that its the second one that has a lot to say? She says all is well and good. Poor Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen’s instinct was that she was INTRUDING in another Ladies marriage 👏🏽and👏🏽she👏🏽was 100% correct. Polygamy sucks no matter how calmly they try to convence themselves and others otherwise. Ladies LOVE yourself! VALUE yourself! And on top of that FIRST thing he mentions is he values them/desires them because “..they are light skin” they aren’t even light..BESIDES he’s DARK how dare he😂 Also, this is why HIV is soo pervasive because CHEATING, never satisfied, FALSELY entitled, “men”! BTW Cera was completely wronged😢The more he talks the more of a complete asshole he shows himself to be. Ugh🤢absolutely No way! Poor Maureen should have waited to meet her very own man🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera isn’t even light
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like it when men treat women like rags.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is NOT lovable. He has a wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh my days... Unreal. Would Abraham be okay with each of his two wives each getting another man? please madam Lynn bring this family for an interview in 2030 and we see how things will be like
q4sWUJxjc4g,No thank you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,At first i thought Cera was the second wife because of how much more beautiful she is. Damn.
q4sWUJxjc4g,NONSENSE....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera be strong ❤,I wish your husband could see beauty in you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera be strong ❤,I wish your husband could see beauty in you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My guy, you are the luckiest man on earth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray for the first wife and I pray that this should not happen to any woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is more beautiful than Maureen. Being more light skinned doesn’t mean she’s beautiful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My fear is, l can see Abraham cheating on them all and engaging another girl. He seems to be a play boy. My grandpa too had two wives but when he accepted Jesus, he was forced to leave his second wife, even if he still loved her, and shifted with my grandma to another district. Even the second wife, agreed to remain & never got children with her again"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thanks for hosting the trio. They hv good hearts and their story is a great lesson. Thats why they say never act as a wife when u r still courting or friends. But still men lose interest after 2 yes & lust  even when he loves his wife. As for Abraham surely uv  bn selfish & insensitive to the woman of your youth. She's that woman material & acts maturely with painful patience. Love is never shared amongst 3 people. Even our creator said is a God of jealousy if Wr engage other gods. Maureen too is a super soul but very human & compromised her dignity. Can she were Cerah's shoes? Its painful to see the father of your babies, your first love swift so early in your relationship.  Men plz stop breaking hearts of our daughters. U miss blessings. U delay or avoid commitment, knowing traditional marriages, men can marry 2 or more wives. But surely Abraham grow up don't pretend, one day you will see the grave mistake you are doing to those ladies. I salute Cerah,  God will reward you in a mighty way and if Maureen's heart comes to her senses she will leave you Abraham. What a worse lesson for your children. Abraham, you are psychologically torchering  Cerah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I identify with this am from a polygamous family, my Mums are great friends and we the children are friends, it's a great thing if both are genuine, have no ill feelings and no psychological issues and no regret.
The husband must be genuine, not mean and not biased.
My Dad was a great father leader and a priest of the house"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy is very naughty
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What example are they setting to there children?
For me this is rubbish and luck of manners"
q4sWUJxjc4g,His language  my empire further exhibits his controlling manipulative  behaviour. Run ladies like yesterday.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cant believe  these beautiful  women are under the sspell of this  man. You are better than this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do these ladies have any level  of confidence  or self esteem. Walm away like tomorrow.  He will do it again.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hope one day these ladies know thier worth  and how beautiful they are and they can move away from this manipulative beast.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Beautiful story,but my Question is for Mr Abraham,what would you do if Cera brought home a man and told you that one of your kids is from him and that she would like all of you to live together?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Giirl you know damn well that, that man will put her out of his home with out her kids so that the other one would have to take care of his children. In africa the laws are mostly on the mans side."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good question
q4sWUJxjc4g,So who is always first during love making? This is disgusting. 🧐🧐🧐🧐
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't think the first lady is happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"She's like most people think😂
No sis ,deep down you know you are a destroyer😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is evil don't copy American.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Have for sure loved their story and how I wish every woman is happy as they're I speak blessings upon them and may their love blossom God loves peace and He's peace Abraham thank you for setting a good example out here cause there are men whore serial cheaters
q4sWUJxjc4g,If it works for you embrace it... Don't be a judgemental society ..they are all mature and one can make an mature individual decision..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Anga who is happy anga what let them make their decision
q4sWUJxjc4g,Auuui sijawatch but nefa efa.I cannot accept.Najipenda sana Siwezi kubali such nonesense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But let truth be told,serah hayuko sawa,ama ndio anakaanga akiwa na furaha"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Like the show!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow. I don't understand some of what's. Going on? He  said his wife was the full package but. Yet you Need. An Addition person. It sounds like the 2nd wife is saying. He convinced her to be with him but she's concerned about his family., He's also trying name to let you think hes honest after after he got caughe was not honest in the 1st place.. It's wonderful that that both ladies see each other as friends but but what what would?  Have happened the the table was turned. I am asking the question thisplay because I am not in Africa look up. I'm in the Caribbean."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is so pretty and calm.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ila Cera ni mpole jamaniii.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen let herself down. The moment you realise a married man is after you , just run away and keep off!! Turn him away completely otherwise you might have to walk out too late.  You were a secrete at some point meaning not a proud act but a guilt goon."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not easy, lets speak the truth first wives pretend or they live in free gear"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"a man and half, “i do not trust him” he is more to wife number two"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a time Bomb, this man will die early, when these two women come together Genuinly"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah anawapima bangi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is better than a lot of men cheating outside there...hope he doesn't add another wife but I'd rather see my man open up than hiding ...I respect serah..its hard but you're managing
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's clear he loves moreen
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is not happy just doing it to please a man she didn't want him to leave
q4sWUJxjc4g,This triggers me so bad 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The shoes tells it all, Maureen and Abraham are matching, in whites and then here is our serah in black symboling sadness..
I am a kid from polygamous family and I know what serah is going through as the first wife..serah stop acting, stop sugar coating, please it will erupt."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Love is jealous. Therefore, this is not love use another word instead."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes out to Sarah!!!! I try but I have no pity for the second wife or husband (laughing at hurtful moments).  Sorry I tried but I pray Sarah find the man for her and only her who loves her!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah looks more beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen looks old
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is not happy.The husband snatcher and the narccist are happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn i love ur program so much n i learn alot from it. Even though i dont understand the part when the speak ur language,bc am from Ghana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,the spirit that Cerah carries in her is just out of this world. Much respect but I still want to cry on her behalf though even if she is ok.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the legend😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,This country is good where to have 2 wives is possible
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you're in love but you deserve better baby girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,he is always looking at Maureen. more eye contact with her than with Cerah. Cerah is not happy can see it
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Hawa wawili hawataki kuacha huyu mjamaa juu ya pesa yake .😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Sarah is yet to recover..she is in pain I know there will be no woman who will realy be ok with her man akienda na mwingine😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,GOD way aren’t our ways neither GODs thought our thoughts.Congratulations Abraham there are nuclear family and most men aren’t responsible.Sera acceptance was because dispite having a side chick you are still responsible and love your children
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can imagine the way they enjoy that Three some thing every day
q4sWUJxjc4g,I Love the way they are all happy and making jokes. This should set an example to the rest that finds themselves in such a setup and not to call them names etc.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The verse is true 😂 u you men too
q4sWUJxjc4g,You must be a men and don't afford to have more than one woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Good work Lynn, Hongera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,To sum it all its high time women to STOP being their own enemies so that we can build a society free from same sex marriages.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pole cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,waw i like cera attitude ....mimi nliaribu waaa it was fetal
q4sWUJxjc4g,My two wives left me almost at the same time because they both found out they couldn't manage being in polygamy. How you manage having all of them in the same house makes you a genius Mr Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true we clap for him
q4sWUJxjc4g,Le Grand In Koni Kare
q4sWUJxjc4g,Both left you at the same time? Did they find out about each other? Jalni mon gi biro tieke
q4sWUJxjc4g,The same house set up is another level
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really love their bond kapsa your story makes it possible to get things on that platform
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Marrying two women is common but keeping them in the same house is a total shame. We all know what happens in the bedroom,  They might be keeping  awake at night."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wait until he gets broke or old, the knives will spring out....mscheew! He is loved because he provides..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is not keen to tell us he loves Sera....perhaps that's the confidence Maureen has,,that she's the loved one."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The darker one does not look happy. I hope this man will not end up adding a third wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No man can love 2 people at the same time you love one and aybe you are fond of the other .stop it you don't know what love is my dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham stop cheating people that one heart can love two hearts equally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really sympathize with Serah one day she will come to regret why she allowed her co-wife to stay, stop cheating people that you are free with each other. I wish Serah will come for the show after 4years and share the bitter testimony she will be in. Seemingly Serah is trying to worship Abraham to stay. I have never seen co-wives living happily, never n never. Abraham is using Serah to settle his scores n Maureen is trying to put on a sheep's skin to grow roots."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I trust that is your belief. It happens one in a while 🎉❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Felt like crying throughout the interview...i know its not i sweae
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish Serah the best..notice how the two of them coordinated there dressing..wait for the 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh no serah I hope one day you wake up and have the guts to choose your own happiness over what that kinuthia had convinced you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, 

in the Bible you are the father of many tribes and nations. Just because you are no king or Emperor, no one has any right to judge. You have made a decision and chosen to marry 2 wives rather than the norm, and that is path. You say you love both your wives, and that is all that matters.

Every King in the Bible had more than one wife. True fact. That is why only a few of the Kings wives are ever written about in the Bible. 

To Cerah,

 only you know what it is like to be where you are. And you are where you are because of the choices you (and no other person) have made. And you will continue to make those choices as independently for the rest of your life. It is the choices we make in life that determine our paths in life. And the feelings you have are as a result of your choices. I commend you (with lots of love and admiration) for accepting Maureen and her child into your family. I believe it wasn’t easy but you are brave. I feel that you are very loving, caring and compassionate. You say you are happy and you love your husband and you sister wife, and that is all that matters. 

To Maureen,

it isn’t that easy to take that bold step to walk into another woman’s territory. But you are brave, if I may say. And I should thank Cerah for being the person she is. You have decided and you have chosen the path that which you desired and therefore you are where you are. And like I said about Cerah, you will also continue to make those choices for the rest of your life to determine where you want to be going forward. You say you are happy and you love your husband and your sister wife, and that is all that matters.

To the Abraham family,

life isn’t about making easy choices. If it was, then we wouldn’t be where we are today. There are those who will judge based on the norms of society and Christian Principles. But life was never meant to be perfect. That is why we believe in love and forgiveness and in our Faith. 

We all live based on the choices we make in life. Where there for good or bad, I’d based solely on the choices we make, because we were created with one unique gift and that is reason. 

I, too, believe in love and am a Christian. And because I do not know what you all feel and go through on a daily basis, nor is it any of my business. How you live is your choice, for better or worst, is up to you all.

I wish you all the very best and may you all live a loving, caring and respectful lives with your children. 

God bless."
q4sWUJxjc4g,the beauty goes to the first wife. She is amazing and pretty.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Do not let people put you down. They are not in your shoes, and they will never understand where yours pinches you. You have chosen your path, and it is NOT another's path - it is working now, NOW is all you have. Enjoy it and learn and grow as needed."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You need a kick in your dirty no-good ass,how could a woman allow such foolishness, you both are so stupid, he loves it because he could have a different pum pum every night, are have the two 2⃣ of you at the same time, nasty rass"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man makes me sick to the stomach. He is so selfish and desolutioned, wanting to eat his cake and still have it. There is nothing like loving two people at the same time. Even the bible says you can't serve two masters at a go for you will love one and hate another. And this Maureen, I wish she could reverse the roles and ask herself how she would have felt if she was happily married to this man and later found out that Cera was coming in as a second wife saying she's not coming to destroy her marriage but rather to make a good wife. I wonder if she would have accepted that as a true statement and welcomed her with both arms. Indeed people only care about themselves and they are ready to take anything out of another person's hand to make themselves happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes out to Serah, this makes me very angry; he is a master manipulator that's all. And sometimes we women are gullible to the men lies and selfishness. Abraham cheated and married his side chick period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So this is the point at which Satan has raised the demon jezebel, jezebel you will never  win in Jesus name,fire fire fire jezebel this is adultery before God and a sin. 1Corithians 9:1"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the bitter truth, apparently God can't force His Will on people"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wanacheka hapa but first wife bdo akona kidoda kwa roho....if it was for me nigewaweka kila mtu pekeake Bora wanajuana
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter how Sara is pretending we can see it on her face ...she's hurt and still not recovered...now the hubby thinks he's oky juu alicheat na Sara akakubali my friend you should apologize everyday to that woman she's deeply battling alot.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waluhya wote please kujeni uku🤔🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,🙏 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I love your show. You ask guests questions in English and they can’t reply in one language. Please add captions for your diaspora & also viewers from other African countries. Kenyans seem to be the only country where people can’t stick to one language.  Thanks
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are right I'm not from Kenya but I watch this program but when they are speaking in their vernacular and are expecting me to subscribe . Lynn what do you think
q4sWUJxjc4g,Deception
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, this is a show just like any show.  If you follow about sister wives in the US (MR. BROWN). Also, see Dr. Mwaka in Tanzania who said he sleeps with all his three wives last year.  But this year, one of the wives is seeking divorce.  In fact, now the relationship is really bad. The husband has mistreated the wife very badly. The wife who is asking for divorce expose that they were having TOXIC RELATIONSHIP! Abrahim, Serah & Maureen, give yourself 5 to 10 years. You will know then. In a normal way, human way, love is not divided"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah body language is so obvious that she is just drugged into this love triangle. She is kind of lost and probably doesn't know what to do. What is the next step
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki hii siamini hadi kuna mwenye anasikianga ka wivu. Mimi lynn aki siwezi . My man with another woman heri ni wawache
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your name is Abraham mwangi. Not my names are.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is the main key player here. He needs to keep the balance between them. The reality of life is that most men cheats, take it or leave it. Bringing them together is the best decision for the children. Let’s pray for their union."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And he will still cheat on the two
q4sWUJxjc4g,"KJV Proverbs 1:7
7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

KJV Genesis 2:24
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
KJV Proverbs 3:5
5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Foolish man he cannot even say this are my views
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn just a humble request, please add subtitles. Your fan from South Africa 🇿🇦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I’m not okay with this 😢 the fact that he cheated first is my biggest issue.. if he had asked her at the start and told her what she was signing up for then that’s okay.. but first cheating then giving conditions and later parading it saying it’s an agreement isn’t right.. wish Cera all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good u said what I was thinking
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the comment I was looking for, like how 🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Are  exactly the words The words to say here
q4sWUJxjc4g,They 3 are so mature
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am so sorry I can't take this never
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There are billions of men on this planet, yet low self esteem will have a beautiful woman thinking this is the best she can do and she has to accept fake forced polygamy 😓"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They seem to be taking it in stride now, but seems like a simple case of cheating that he cleaned up with the ‘polygamy’ label."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To me its obvious that he loves the second wife more coz he said he wasn't ready to lose her
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think serah's body language and facial expressions talks something different from her words 😪
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii nayo ni uongo 💔 I lack words to describe the betrayal, narcissism and pretence here. Anyway peace upon Sarah, not the way to go honestly."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks for seeing these. Men here busy applauding him.  Cerah aki namhurumia Sana.. ako in a situation and she is not financially in a position of moving out
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The pain of knowing someone you love, loves another cuts too deep."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A man is perfectly capable of loving more than one woman at a time, something no woman can understand

Women simply just need to accept men for who and what they are instead of what a woman wishes him to be 👍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Absolutely. I can not never be this girl 
I can’t handle that deep cut in my heart.
I will lather be single"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very deep I can't imagine it Dunia ilipasukanga kitambo the truth is he never loved his wife if he did he wouldn't look for another plain Truth
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So this guy actually cheated on his wife and then forced her in a form of persuasion to accept this woman, his intentions were not pure moss. He lied to his wife (by not telling her about this woman)and lied to the mistress (by not being upfront about being a married man)I thought in polygamy everything is put out in the open right from the beginning. I don't believe this union is pure and it will last 🤔both these women are just holding in their true feelings, they are being pretentious."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Deep
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaaw they look so happy together❤️❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry I couldn't listen to the whole interview since it's a polygamy and the bible is against that.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ukapikiwa ukanona ukamua kumcheat
q4sWUJxjc4g,This cerah is not happy.. Its written allover her. .. I hope she does what's best for her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,To each their own
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We used to talk"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are so fack  you should  leave  someone's  husband  and God will give you your own husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's a bit late to post this but first off it's amazing to see the women together and being happy it's beautiful to see co wives.
I just feel for the man and any man planning to have another wife aside from the first should have enough courtesy to tell them both early enough, introduce them and let them know as is in due respects.
Women we are territorial and to share a home esp now in our age it's hard. But honesty and being respectful and mindful of both party's feelings and outward approach is very key. I feel like the guy failed there,cause as he is saying that he was scared of loosing both meaning he was playing a chess board with both lady's and lady's are not stupid. 
Anyway all the best to the family,it's beautiful 🥂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see a 3rd one coming sooner if not later.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kuna huyu Milly ako na mtoto wake Pia.. this Abraham is clearly a womaniser yaani Malaya ya mwanaume
q4sWUJxjc4g,People stay in your lane. Especially those speaking for Cera as if she doesn’t have a mind of her own. These women are empowered in their own way!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is a no go area for me.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera, may peace locate you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What's sad is that even when you say you're in a monogamous marriage, there are some spouses that are ""cheating"" which is technically polygamy. The difference is one knows and accepts the other person and the other doesn't know about the side person. At the end of it all, what would you rather deal with?  We need to be real in that just as a husband would want another wife, a wife may want another husband. Only bite what you can chew and swallow. Live your truth so everyone is aware of how things are moving."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Real reality
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen looks way much older
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And there is no guarantee that because he has married more than one wife, he can not cheat."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that you slept with another woman outside and impregnant her was just a bigger picture that you were so done with Serah!. I think Serah is staying for just peace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is still not recoverd
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like the show how can l be able to meet Lynn ngugi
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,A joke to say his house is build on respect when he totally disrespected his wife to satisfy his desires. His wife looks hurt and heartbroken.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sure, 🤔the world is coming to an end soon! Let’s us all repent! Sin is sin let’s not cover it 😢.  I see these as one of the signs."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Going through comments forum... This WILL WORK and there is GOD in it... These are intelligent women and they are a good example of where the world is moving to.  They are trend setters that it can be possible as long as each knows their space and conflict resolution property/wealth well  managed and much listening to themselves that what the society expects of them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry but a polygamy can't worked based from cheating....if he was open to cerah earlier before he married her ....she won't be in this dilemma ..that man lied and cheated to her first wife...didn't you hear she cried?????? Tf
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmh lemme guess you're a cheating man too..enyewe
q4sWUJxjc4g,Key word... Both are hardworking..... is it what he loves naturally or for himself.. for their good or for his good?... His eye may continue finding many other hardworking women.....  Men are from Mars women are from venus
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is just a Lucky guy,may God bless you all with your children."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This ain't funny aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wow!watched this Family interview,Yes this is Beyond love,those commenting negatively if it didnt work for you at least be happy for other people.Serah and Maureen youre just amazing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife I can tell she's not happy 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't watch this honestly 😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor Cerah😞 .She said that she is fine but her eyes and body language says it all. She knows that she either share or Maureen will have the whole cake on herself. Just a matter of time and Maureen will be enjoying what she has been after from the beginning.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And given that ,she worked and invested with a man for 8yrs"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is no happy married of two wives, thats cheating or facking, there,is one who's suffering,  the man forget his children even he couldn't remember to care for, wait for the third wife,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera has never healed, pain is written all over her face"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is a mature woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you totally asked so many Q cerah  has never gotten an answer 🙄 😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cereh ix just comforting herself bt she nt comfortable,my opinion ix yhey should seperate the houses,kila mtu akae standard yake"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me and jealousy we are best friends I can't end of reletionship
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah should walk out of that pain he's so ungreatful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah seems to have been forced to do this interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hmmmm this feels painful to me....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah  is completely  brainwashed
q4sWUJxjc4g,May you come to your normal  mind  and leave you are a beautiful  woman  you can get a husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is not called  consideration, it's manipulation  and brainwashing  there's  nothing  that is called  beyond  love   its what he's  getting  from them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a selfish man, he didn.t really know what he wanted in his life, it's not possible to keep two women under the same roof, he also betrayed Serah by going out of his peaceful lovely matrimonial home to have extra marital affairs with Maureen, l really felt for Serah, because this is a total betrayal on  from her husband, she is only trying to play along so that peace can rain in her home. Abraham wanted to keep Serah maybe because she is a good home maker, cool and patient and also kept Maureen because of his business so that she could help him run his business, this is absurd, selfishness and betrayal. Thank you Lynn."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Better huyu hawezi kujugde na ni understanding,Kuna yule ni blame Kila saa na anataka kukuletea cowive"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueeeeeh when Lynn asked serah,,'as a woman?'' 😭😭😭😭😭💔her response manze"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is he talking like a luo? DNA check please
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only one enjoying this is the Guy. Both women wanaogopana; but truly they are good women
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nice beautiful family but cerah looks more younger than Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Seems the man shielded the 2nd more..he never assured Cera that he still loves her...all he thought was material 
Ati  I won't stop supporting you, WTH?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a selfish man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Then ati he liked her cause she cleaned and washed clothes 😑
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The deception from this man.....ati l felt l was not getting ABC from Cera.....
Dang! Can the women look beyond if they do not get whatever from this Dude 🥴🥴🥴"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is not okay,,, hope she gets well, the guy just took advantage of her calmness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eh!! Wasichana warembo hivi??? Over my dead body😏😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a different-sad-level of a story... life's never easy for anyone but karma's such a freakin'ly loyal bitch- never disappoints...at the end of the day, we all get fairly rewarded by cakes or sticks"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The whole set up doesn't sit well with my spirit..but hey, each  to their own. I wonder  how Ceras parents  reacted to this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"he want to be seen as a king,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,sera hutoki kwanini
q4sWUJxjc4g,the husband is shinning lakini hapa hakuna raha.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wakanda of nonsense is this?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pyscologically by look ad the way she narrates how they meet at their first sight love,  There is higher possibility Cera will never get the ultimate reason or correct answer why the second woman Was brought in between,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God give Cerah abundant grace for her faithfulness which her husband couldn't give back.Shame!
q4sWUJxjc4g,24:20 The fact that you felt guilty you should have loved your wife even more to ABOLISH the mission. What a world!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But Maureen, when thunder fires you, dont say that you dont deserve it. Even God is against adultery and polygamy. Polygamy is not a blessing . It's a clear road to painful judgement from God."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woishe Lynn you're making it to be more sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish them all the best in life....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like that, your enjoying, life is two shot!?  Or so me am looking life like that!?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,All I see is a selfish MAN!!!!😏😏😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have really withheld myself from watching this video but finally I did....huhuhuuuu I'd die before this happens to me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Girls be warned Tafuta mtu wako stop breaking homes
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can a man serve two master's at a time ...definitely not he would either love one and hate the other....God is watching
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The only part that got me emotional is about cerah not being lucky 💔 in life,and yet again she convinced to having Abraham as one of the good luck,which is not true.But God I know you will take care of everything 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The reason why we shun our traditions is poverty, if you inform your spouse about polygamy and she agrees, and you can be able to support both of them, it's okay 👌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, thanks for this masterpiece presentation. It was very inspired now hunting for wife number two 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is pretending with the baby. Oh what a kind woman Moureen !
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah ukianza kwenda out, just run away from these two, ull be happier Living with your kids away from this man, he doesn't love u but he will support his kids"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki I thot the first thing he told cerah was that regardless of what he's going to tell her, he still loved her but wooiiiee only support....... Abraham doesn't love cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My dad tried this with 3Wives but never worked,Wait when the kids grows.You’re trying what can’t work.The second wife needs her own home,if you want peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cannot be a part of a plural marriage; however it is a personal choice and if they are happy as a family, I respect their choices. Peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The marriage is a life story, and nobody is a hero, it is not a new story it is only representing the Old Testament lifetime. In this century of the end days, it looks awful because of the western culture we are adopting; most women will not accept that. But as long as they are happy why people bother with their life? the wives seem professional and understanding. Most of one man one wife are even bad to divorce nowadays! Mpango wa kando si ni mbaya zaidi? I wish them all the best enjoy life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sodom and Gomorrah started exactly like this. This Foolish man is an emotional abuser. Abraham you are an abomination to female race!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This foolish man says he fell for Maureen because she was light and he has a thing for ladies with light skin. What a foolish , selfish man. The pain in cera will soon be too much to bear. This is pure abuse. May God help you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Lady moureen seems to be so sad deep down her. God help us oo
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu guy alimutharawu moureen Sana. Mungu tusayidiye
q4sWUJxjc4g,I need my wife to ear this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera, may God make a way for you. it isnt good for her. Maureen tafuta kwako, toka kwa cera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wonderful.. I like the couple-triple..♥️ I would like to find out whether polygamy is a sin? Where do we put bible characters who feared God but married more than one wife with concubines. I ve only read emphasis of leaders in church having one wife. Personally the men in polygamous marriage have proved to be more responsible and better than the one-woman-marriage..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope Serah finds courage to leave that man ..... he's not done at Maureen..... he'll have more
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No one can convince me cera is okay about it ,apana noooooo,the other woman found out he is married but went ahead n got pregnant,Hawa ndio wale husema ""siwachani na bwanako"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You still feel guilty, you can't look Sarah in the eye. Thats the problem with sin."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What am certain is that you can't successfully keep two women under same roof and for this it's just a matter of time when these two ladies get proper financial independence which is the real ""glue"" for now"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hello??? Go gave one man one woman!! No way will ever be convinced that this good... NOT
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah run for your life  ,.  You  will die of depression bana , hebu jipende  mamaa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love cera Hugs mumy...😍😍the Habraham is  a vibe eish
."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Time will tell sera you are woman and half
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is beautiful. period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Damn! I’m heartbroken for Sera 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This story is nothing short of disgusting. Maureen is very dishonest, she knew she was wrecking another woman’s marriage and purposely got pregnant by the disgraceful Abraham. 
You can see the pain in Serahs eyes but it’s obvious she’s let her adulterous husband get away with a lot from the start and this is was one of those many instances.This is a a violation of the institute of marriage intended for one men and one woman. May they all reap what they sow."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This seems like a fantastic polygamous relation.  However, rivals [terminology for both wives] cannot be friends, though, that's why they are called rivals.  One can pretend but deep down in the heart, they prefer to have been the only wife.   There has to be an atom of jealousy here, come one, they are not sisters.   May God bless you all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The ego and arrogance in abraham iko group of schools.   Like she didn't even tell serah sorry am wrong. Ati yes i have a kid with maureen and i love her so much.  Like really?. I just imagined hearing this from my husband  . Serah may God bless u. You are one rare 💎 gem. How did you even react after being told that way.  My man telling me he loves another woman so much. And am not ready to.lose them . What about us?. Ati i have no intention of chasing you from my life . Sikufukuzi. He talks like he is doing maureen a favour... no wonder lynn asked how about love... may God heal you serah u are not okay. And you are there juu u had no option.  The man knows u well and also maureen knows u well watakutumia vibaya coz they know the kind of person u r.  U have a pure hrt with pure intention... dony even fake that u love maureen and u r okay. Its written all over u.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Story of another day,lyn let me heal,nitakutafuta celah is lucky,  Kuna wengine wamewekelewa watoto wawili outside marriage  and infact these are his quotes ""I can't leave the kids nor the baby mamas, they are part of me"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is STINK, STINK, STINK"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Taking serahs kindness for weakness..a man fullfilling his sexual needs from two women.lust
q4sWUJxjc4g,Witholding information is defined as cheating and for your dear child to unmask this web of deceit is very painful and scaring to your child
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Dear Maureen, you made a wrong decision but you can always turn away, it is never too late.
Dear Abraham, you were neglecting your wife and children, hiding your daughters picture, to woo a woman that is not love and respect that is infatuation and deceit.
deleting your daughter's picture like she is a shame to you, that is not a fathers love that is proper deceit"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really love the way you handled this show Lynn you really gave us what we would want to hear
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Umalaya sanitized,and desperation on the side of the 2nd woman. Non of these two women is happy. This man is the most selfish manipulative human of modern times"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Zombie womens, manipulative guy. The whole set up is toxic and raising kids is the most terrible thing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A man of...me,me and more me!🤮🤮"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Selfish man, always wants the good girls all to himself"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is sheer nonsense. Sara u got a raw deal here!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapo kuna mmoja anaumia kwa ndani hakunaga mapenz ya ku share mume afu mpatane 😮wapi dr mwaka na manara😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So while the rest go..

I love this girl sooo much i want to spend the rest of my life with me 

There is an Abraham 
Ahhh... this looks like a good slave to clean after me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this story  is hard.serah is not as she has said.the second wife is a pretender.she has alot of pride.serah is not happy  even now.Abraham is too young  for 2 wives.No....No...
God doesn't  allow this.period.they can pretend now,but no blessings  at all.i cannot  allow myself. i grew in a polygamous  family  where my mum was the first  wife.too calm in that she allowed the  second wife.but i  came actually  to know last month  that,my mum gave birth  to 2 girls and my grandmother  side of my father  refused her.since she didn't  give our dad a baby boy.to cut the story  short, i dont think sarah is happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i don't  agree.  God does not  allow  this.And more so,I'm  from a polygamous  family,and it didn't  work  well.mmm sijui,aki sijui"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the reaction would have been different if Maureen was the first wife. She wouldn't accepted it. Let's not glorify infidelity in the name of love. Cerah is hurting from inside
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ya true.she needs counseling.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She must open a branch 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah you're in my prayers cause waah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Eish, I feel like Abraham assures the younger wife more. He should atleast assure the 1st wife also. They wouldn't even be here if it was not her kindness but then again I'm just a spectator and i know it might be difficult for him as he's only human and can't cut himself in half. But please he needs to be careful and not expect that the first wife will always be there. In other words not take her for granted after all she's done for you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I believe God made one woman for one man. Polygamy at all costs is ""sanitized adultery"". That is the standard. God sets the standard for marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,aki cerah is not happy at all.... i feel her pain.... you struggle with someone then he does that weuh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Im glad  you guys or happy and thats what  matters
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sorry for Cerah, we man though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ngugi....that story is really going to cause a wrong impact to young men.
Because this man may never say either the first wife say so.
The man must have told her you either take it or leave it....
And this can give crazy boys strength to do such crazy thing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,At the end of the day love will always win
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women don't love each other 🤦. No love to them. Cerah was forced for things to happen. The dude was playing her 😩😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are these women this desperate? After all the global effort of empowering the girl child???
q4sWUJxjc4g,oh wow  take good care of the family
q4sWUJxjc4g,oh wow please be don't worry be happy build  and protect the togetherness
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless you Cerrah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What's this?
Serah is pretending but wife 2 will leave at the right time. This is not her home"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But why does Cera look younger and more beautiful, hugs to you Cera 🥰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,At first  I thought cerah ndiye home breaker  coz she look very young...until I listened  the whole story ndio nikajua yy ndiye first wf
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,sure ...she looks younger than moureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same she she is young cera is younger than moreen definitely
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ooh my!!! I feel for Cera😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uyu mwanamme bona tyme ya serah ya kuongea anamkata na hakati moureen?? She's hurting inside
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah you deserve better may God give you strength to open your eyes and see you’re really in pain darling i mean who wouldn’t be..and Abraham is really self centered 😒this is Male chauvinism
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not God doing brother it's against God's will , just say it is your own choice.  Read the bible very well, you will find out after earth life 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love btwn Co wives  is a lie  Ile bomb italipuka hapa  acha  nisionge sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,I keep telling ladies stop giving husband benefits to boyfriend. When sera was in courtship she could wash clothes and cleaning the house Etc .many girls do such mistakes! I can never 👎 go in a guy’s house and start doing all that for him .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sending Hugs 🫂 to Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First time watching this story and at 46min,i truly felt it for cerah.. Only time will tell ..only time will tell for this union.. i pray for you cerah,no matter how you want to to make it rosy.. noooh your eyes tell it all .."
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have been avoiding this interview but finally i feel like looking straight into Abraham's face and give him a sharp slap for betraying cerah.he was ready to loose you when he said to you that could be an end to your marriage.cerah you are still young move out and find happiness,wanaume si kumi na mbili like the disciples. This other hypocrite,husband snatcher...nkt.i could use all the abuse but...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't watch this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mi ata nimependa sitaki hii story tena nahurumia serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi I feel for cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is in pain. Which I can totally relate. It's her maturity that held her strong. I hope she gets to heal. The pain and questions are written on her face. She just doesn't like dram and I believe if they didn't have children already already she would have walked out.

There is no single day such a set up wouldn't have an oppressed party. They are sugar coating so much.

If onlyCerah could get to say her story in person. People would understand her pain better."
q4sWUJxjc4g,GOD is LOVE and their are in LOVE! Leave them alone and stop trying to separate them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You are the most happiest Family! May GOD Bless you! Only failure people to love other are complaining! No where in Bible it’s mentioned “
It’s forbidden to get more than one wife “ so keep your view out of GOD’s Way! Stop judging others for their choice! You just misunderstood GOD’s Words ! It’s not forbidden! Salomon got more than 600 Wives! Jesus wasn’t married but while Bible says “ Let’s get married “ stop putting mess in people Family! Keep your misunderstanding to your house! People like you want people in conflict! You can clearly see them very proud and no one is in slavery and very successful where you probably failed and you can’t probably keep a man to yourself so repent and copy their life then be happy my dear😂❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no love here. Its just three people staying in one house.  Leave God out of this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Be blessed family and don't forget Bible say second wife is girl friend not wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Man you cheated on your wife and you are still cheating her.  Bringing the other lady in the house does not mean its okay. It's  WRONG?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Go beyond love"". What is the meaning of this?. He meesed up and he is torturing the first wife. 
Abraham if one of your wives  find another man and fall in inlove with him, will you get hurt or it will be beyond love as you say it.
Stop pretending guys. The first wife knows very well that she is not happy at all. There is nothing like sharing is caring when it comes to relationships."
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no way  1 person can love 2 people and there is no way 2 women can love 1 man. This is just a comprise.  Ceera is just there but in pain.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Happy or Compromise?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just watched you guys and trust me your all amazing
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow!! Abraham your a Man of the Year, i like the way you handle your 2 wives, you should be the chairman for the next Men Conference, Congratulations and May God Bless you all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't this is too ""bazar""  Any self--esteem an issue?  Well damn, really!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You were just a horrible person, you slept with her husband!  Just say the ""Lust"" got the best of you and ask TMH for forgiveness!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Adultery will never be ok!  I hope Serah's family will support her when she leaves!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope she/(Serah) finds someone just for her!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"and he is very ""selfish"" to ruin the lives of these women"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You cannot love them both, a very gullible and greedy man in deed, he will still go out and cheat on them both."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Surprised to hear that there is a value more than love when it comes to marriage. The Reason why you went out to add another woman secretly couldn't ha been  a value. However I respect the first wife for understanding.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn.....much  love from middle  East
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know why am crying watching this. Am yet to get married and am brought up from a family where dad decided to bring another woman I know how hurting it was to mum. Everything in this story is wrong. I hope there was a solution having gone all this long. But in everything your peace matters. 😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mamaaa I'm scared of getting married
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@emmahkajuju18 just make sure that you have a job and your money. If a man starts any nonsense you can’t put up with, you move work and start your life. Sarah had no income, how was she going to feed those kids if she left this man plus he had already told her that he’s not going to leave the side chic. Sarah is trapped in this unhappy marriage, the sadness is written all over her face and body language. She manages to hide the sadness through her words but we can all see how sad she is."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pole
q4sWUJxjc4g,"THAT IS serious GASLIGHTING 😢. People abuse you and we tried to neglect it. That negro is abused of those women. He will bring wife # 3,4,5 and 6. Ladies wake-up please. Sorry, i am an African woman that grew up in United States. This is crazy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Before you people condemn this family read exodus 21:10.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I ain't judging, would Maureen have birthed him a baby when he was cutting sukuma??....this man never loved Cerah, he loved her shoes & the maid she was. Then he has no shame of just reassuring Cerah of the fact that he will care for the children; he only talked of love only when Lynn probed him..Serah's body language speaks volumes..build them separate houses in the same compound or, a Mansion with different entrances...Sina maoni.But, what am seeing it dangerous to married to a poor person & to be cheaply got. Magumu haya, but as Cerah said, God's grace; let me pretend to believe her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeee!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Much is being concealed here. After the end of laughter,begins life.
However I wish them well. And I also believe their laughter is genuine."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What made Abraham to get a second wife? Does it mean that he was not satisfied with Serah, you the second wife, were you so desperate that you couldn't find your own man? Stop infringing Serahs rights let her enjoy the whole man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Quite interesting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't bring myself to understand this, oh my God,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eeeh! It is grace indeed. You trio are special and I wish you continued happiness and growth
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To each his own. We are not all cut from the same cloth...anyone judging is just projecting their own opinions- which is okay, thats what commentary is about"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He only loves one woman. He dìd not know how to dispose the other.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Saitan
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, Maureen wasn't telling him to go home bcos of genuine love for Cera. She was giving Abraham the impression that she was a good person."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Such a young man. I'm sure he's not done with two 😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,I also thought so
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,3rd wife tena 4th
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Na wa o,this man is so proud of what he has done. After eight years,he went to bring his side chick into the house. The heart is desperately wicked,who can know it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,i think he’s a wizard honesty and his side chick the queen of the coast
q4sWUJxjc4g,Na wa o 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Their laughter does not sound genuine. Something is off,but good for them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Personally I don't think I can take these....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Gosh Mimi hii nguvu Sina kapsaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"congrats girls.  Your respect for one another is admirable. You remind me of my  grandmothers.  Abraham you are a real man. After messing up you took responsibility. By doing so, God poured a lot of grace to your two wives. Thank you for coming out and speak the truth instead of being hypocrites. May God give we wisdom and recourses coz you can't look back now ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They truly handled the transition very maturely. I believe the relationship will go a very long way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man will marry again
q4sWUJxjc4g,What one can't tolerate there is someone else ready and willing . God created us in unique way God be with them and help them in all their challenges.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This things happen and it's normal once the husband is a family man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen  dear, I just wanted to know how you are feeling, Iam not in the situation  but this was so painful  for me."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham your cheating huyo mkeo jamn serah run
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham your cheating huyo mkeo jamn serah run
q4sWUJxjc4g,he will definetely take  a third wife am telling you happy happy chai chai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I got into this situation in 1990.The animosity between the 2 women persisted until the sad demise of the first wife early this year. I dont recognise my second wife because i see her as a home breaker. Surely she is just like Maureen!! Polygamy doesn't work and whether you camouflage or sugarcoat it as I have seen in this video, it just doesn't work !!!
It breeds hate,suspicion,fights name it!!!
I would not in my sober senses advise any man or woman to be involved in this.
Kaa na Bibi yako hata akiwa surambaya.
I regret what I did in 1990.If I could turn back the clock I wound rewind it to 1989!
You cannot love two people at the same time! Impossible!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If it didn't work for you it doesn't mean it has worked for others they many polygamous marriages/families and are far much better than monogamous marriage.  Men who has more than wife have more authority in their homes than monogamous especially when kids are grown-up and they are wrestled from the father to the mothers side. The man has an alternative, the wives compete for attention from the man, in this scenario the man rule supremo."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@solomonkuriah7517 Try it!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@solomonkuriah7517 and such men eat alot of juju.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If yours failed, it doesn't mean everyone else can fail. Even monogamous marriages fail also. Selfishness in today's women makes marriages fail. Our forefathers practised it, and ones wealth was measured by the  no. of wives and children one could support. This nonsense of one wife, one matchet, is foreign to our rich African culture. It is a white man's culture with their jealous mad women. I'm a polygamist and don't have regrets or apologies to make. I'm not rich, but my large family is well provided for, and I'm even happier than most monogamists."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, we need an update on them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"IMO this man,Cera goes to his house cleans shit for him and he is like since I have such a tight schedule this seems a good person to clean my shit and handle that area of my life that I can't so boom  he goes ""there's no need of us living apart just stay..."" and Cera being the naive girl she is accepts the proposal later she meets Maureen a business oriented individual,supplies whatever it is to him or is it his company and with his hawk eyes he sees a business partner in her and boom she goes can we have some coffee as long as you take care of my business I can't afford to loose that element in you and boom she goes on a hunting spree..finally when he is caught he weighs his interest....and apparently he  can neither afford to loose Cera's composure  composure not Maureen's sharpness and businesses...He also can't afford to loose his decency by ditching Cera for Maureen.In short this man does not  know no love neither has he experienced love for what it is he only uses people and situations to serve his interests that's why this relationship has to remain the way it is in presence or absence of love thereof. It's what do you bring on the table"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I totally agree. This man has no love at all. He's just using these ladies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad truth is that this guy is a serial cheater and him marrying a second wife will not stop that. I pity the ladies honestly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Satan is real. woooooooooow
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very unfair treatment of both women. the fact that he hid the second relationship means he was cheating. I think with real traditional polygamy, the wives will know before hand that this is the man's desire. So it will not be a surprise. I have no problem with polygamy when it is done the right way. BUT he put all the weight on the women - he is very irresponsible and selfish, and he lied to his first wife. He put them both into a very difficult position. I don't think it will last. A house built on deceit will not stand."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think human being is just human. Love, whether marital or otherwise  is Love. So, polygamy or monogamy, it is all love. Solomon of the Bible with his wives and concubines,  was blessed of God!! So, no big deal, Sarah has co-wife. Period!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah loves Abraham  for real hadi amelia
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham  is a man and a half
q4sWUJxjc4g,Big up Abraham salute you bro
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, some of the men God used had many wife’s, but it was never God’s intention for a man to have more than one wife. It’s purely the man’s desire and wondering eyes. They justify it and they are very fortunate to have women who accept it. It does not make it right. Maureen is a lovely woman, but why did you let things go that far. You shouldn’t of slept with another woman’s husband in the first place. Abraham couldn’t have achieved this if you didn’t allow it. It seems desperate, it’s the woman who give men the permission for this kind of life style because they afraid to be alone."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mother's, raise your girls to be independent  in life and to respect themselves.  Do rely on any man even is she gets married"
q4sWUJxjc4g,That's where equality comes out from poligamy marriage for us Muslim everything is in the Quran
q4sWUJxjc4g,In NIGERIA This things are very very normal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"waah ,,,No isiwai happen kwangu...hio uzuri itaisha mnione in true colours"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This looks like vindeo and ndrama...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Please l like this family ooo, can any woman come and  pick me  to marry her  husband together."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maybe one day you will surprise the both of them with another woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,What's new here u are using the lady to take care of ur family.God doesn't like ugly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is the gay bla  bla talking too much not allowing the women to share out their motions???🤔🤔something fishy 🤔

q4sWUJxjc4g,"you can see this is fake love and marriage, just on media to make 💸,,mugikuyu hasorrraa with money 💰 they will do anything to go to hell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah appears to be very quiet, it would be good to have a follow up interview after 5 years and then another after 10 years to see how Serah really feels"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn should update us 5 years from now
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This ppl who are craving for a follow up videos don't mean well for this family, in their minds they wish it fail and start saying we knew it will fail......  God will always stand for this family ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a crook.! How would he feel if tables are turned? Such a selfish man! He belongs to the streets
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mapenzi wewe...🔥🔥🔥.... keep it burning📌📌✨✨
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some few days back i saw a conversation for a mokorino lady get married to twins. Here a gentleman marrying two ladies and having their story. My take;if all parties are happy then that is it. These are grown up adults. Polygamy is acceptable in the African setting. May God bless you abundantly!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Third is coming
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moureen is trying to look good and a hard to get, in interview with NTV you said you knew  Cera was in picture.
Hugs CERAH"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"it's not Gods way, we shouldn't blame God for the decisions we make in our lives. let's be honest the ratio between man and woman is 1:5 so some women have no choice but to be 2nd, 3rd wives. this is a better option than Ufisi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah has no option but to accept the 2nd woman otherwise she'll be out. this is foolishness l would rather be single than share my man with another woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is being used as a money bringer in the family.She is an intruder in the family.One day she will be thrown out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Their is nothing new here .its African culture
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Better to have a co wife rather than someone"" hypocrite ""who will go around cheating with ten ladies bravo guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree with that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So what are you promoting to youngsters, keep your happiness, noone knows what happens behind closed doors. God created Adam and Eve..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jamani cera pole
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I watched this all you know what I think , another man will break one away….and I know which one possible"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh please……
q4sWUJxjc4g,why should you take another womans husband     .   How now
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So he “married” Cerah coz of what she could do for him!!!! I’m convinced that cerah has some unresolved childhood trauma and codependency. 
Also, while his wife was pregnant with pendo, this guy was taking Maureen out for coffee dates?! 😬!!!
Abraham never really answers the questions!! He beats around the bush!!! 
Oh my god!!! Abraham and Maureen had a kid without cerah knowing! And when she finds out, he blames her for looking at his phone!! Abraham is manipulative and selfish!! 
It’s hard to view this as genuine polygamy or polyamory because he wasn’t honest from the very beginning."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let's be honest. There's nothing more painful than knowing that you're sharing your partner with someone else. Only death should come between husband and wife. Maureen stop it you are a home breaker
q4sWUJxjc4g,She isn’t. Abraham is
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men have a natural and God-given right to take on more than one woman if he so chooses - a woman's feelings isn't more important than a man's desires
q4sWUJxjc4g,"that is just selfish spirit, they have expressed joy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,More painful to u but not to all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nop abraham is after all abraham ndio alimkatia soo shida iko na abraham problem ni hua mwanamke huonekana mbaya bt loyalty ya bwana iko kwa bibi akiamua kucheat shida iko kwa bwana sio mwanamke
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don’t agree with his  & Maureen’s last comment. You girls don’t take his words see his action.  I am positive he will bring a third one take my words.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow, i am still feeling so hurt watching this story, due to my own experience. I might be wrong, but I have never forgiven a man who has ever cheated on me. I am better alone than share a man, because i am honest. So, it happened to me in my marriage and I will never recover, i believe in honest and true love. Good luck family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God did not give man two ribs but one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen,guilt is written allover you.which family did you come to built when there was already one adorable existing...God will judge you harshly."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so sad and heartbreaking. I hope Cera is really happy.  Some people may be in so much pain but they know how to cover up so well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I was in tears for cerah half of the time. I think she is those women who are flawlessly polite 
 This man could have done better. Many women are drama queens if you find one polite one n supportive then be true to her only"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No she's not happy 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Exactly the first wife isn't happy untill date,she feel so much pain inside"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You intentionally took over someone husband and you are telling us you don't want to get into this,if Abraham wasn't doing well will you have accepted"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray cerah is genuinely happy ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how this story is shared by the three people concerned, 90 percent of viewers, leave this forum with very heavy hearts for Cera. ""To be or not to be.... (polygamous)"" must have been a very difficult decision for her. The intricacies of polygamy life are jarring/excruciating in these modern times we live in. 

There is definitely no admiration for this ""husband"" in this viewership, no matter how he tries to spin the details of how he ended up with an additional wife. As somebody commented in this forum, let's visit this story in another decade or two. Only time will tell the final outcome of this polygamy story of three young people.

We wish you nothing but the best kind & gentlel Cera. 💕 It's your welfare majority 90 percent of the readers/viewers really care about.

I sense Cerah would accept a third wife for the sake of her relationship. 
How much can one take to keep a man? My heart and 🫂 goes for Cerah. It's not easy. 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Dear God, may I never encounter such a selfish man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How does he sleep with both women under the same roof? he's blackmailing them, moreover Sera. She has allowed him to crush her dignity completely, she's fearful and doesn't believe she deserves better. May she find herself one day and tell her true story."

q4sWUJxjc4g,The only thing I disagree is that they all live under the same roof
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They can say what they want and I hope am wrong but just by looking at those two women none of they is happy and more so Cera....being raised in a polygamous family myself,  I wouldnt be in one myself..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God I don't want this to happen to me, coz I will break down 💔"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"A very proud guy. The truth of the matter is, he cheated, justified himself and he's not in love with Maurine. He was infatuated"
q4sWUJxjc4g,As i watch this i just feel my heart is heavy lol i can't support this at all! Serah is going through alot of pain but pretending to okay may be not to lose this man to Maureen.  Earth is hard
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is not fair he flavors More morine... shit..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What is mind bloggling is if it was the other way round.., two husbands one woman it would be an abomination."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor first wife,am sure  you never chose this and its hurtful.dont get led by the nose and agree to everthing just because He and her want you to accept.be honest with self aki,you re way younger and have a long life ahead of you,dont be selfless at your own expense in the future.from a way older woman than you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But at last Maureen ata ukijaribu kuficha you didn't know he was married .......ehe..... atleast ukishika mimba you knew he was married  and you went ahead wuuiiii atumia a mburi 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is Cera really happy?she must be a very strong woman because personally I can't!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That lady Mourine, enemy of marriage, home breaker, you are yet to harvest, and you, mr. man, you are wicked. PERIOD"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hey sara how can you be suer that he is not going to get 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ceera you are so beautiful,,you have a golden heart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mourine doesn't seem to consider the first wife's emotions too.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's true you two are taking advantage of Cerah, there's nothing like loving two women at a time I don't like the second wife thing, it's immorality period!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Abraham man though, how dare he didn't even care about Cerah's emotions and just defended his ego , nkt!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham wewe wacha kutuchezea akili your just enjoying spoofing twice bila kujificha. Your so selfish get this leave God's name out of this madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"DECORATING SIN IN A ANOTHER WAY, THIS WILL END IN PREMIER TEARS, FIRST WIFE SO CUTE NOW HOW WILL KID'S TAKE IT... HAKI I DISCONNECT MY KID'S FROM THIS evil thing or whatever... nothing like loving 2 women at the same time time the Bible  says NO n that's final!!! ati they love each other who?? wee not judging but saying the truth!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a lie Abraham , you can not love two women the same, its either you are very harsh on them. No woman can like to share his man with another woman ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Surely muanze na mtu chini then akipata anaona mwgne , woiye Sara aki I feel for you our girl Sara is not oky no matter how she try to hide"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamists never stop. They have hollowness in their hearts which only the power of God can fill.  Abraham will still get another one who is brown and with high heels. Once a cheater always a cheater..
q4sWUJxjc4g,In the past there are situations that have forced one to marry two wives.my openion.this is not something to rejoice about.people tend to be hypocritical when in public.am sure u guys are not comfortable with this lifestyle.its just a matter of time you will open up
q4sWUJxjc4g,i have never seen this to be honest. I have never thought that such a thing could be real. this calls for elevated minds. may God bless this family forever
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can see anger, pain and hopeless written all over Sarah's face. I grew up in a polygamy family, where my mother was the first wife, to tell you it's no joke. The only time you're treated equally is when your mum is around, in her absence it's drama, abuse , toucher. Even your own father won't stañd up for you. The young wife only pretends to be good for a few years."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is trying too hard to justify his moves but they come out as selfish. What if serah got a guy would he be ok sharing? I believe no. So i agree this is not right and the guy is just selfish.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you for sharing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are you politely confessing that women are monsters and can't support another woman's kids and must oppress the kids whenever other woman is away.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"that was your experience and its not universal ....i grew up in a beautiful polygamous of five mothers.... actually, two of my mothers were sisters."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Create-d6i very interesting outlook but Europe will soon import this polygamy to Africa for some of us to accept.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Cera . She looks plastic and I read alot of manipulation. here. For me  Love is for two.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a no,,,as a second wife  I refuse and and am soon living someone's family alone,,, however good you may try to be, guilty will always kill you,,kwanza the polite first wives are so punishing silently,you always bear the blame,,eeeish noooo,,,there is no glory in polygamy.may God forgive me and help me out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham is manipulative!!! Cera hapo you are not doing yourself justice girl .
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is where we see the Power of money....Akh pesa wewe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You can have everything but in reality its not acceptable in African cultures these days and it can trigger tension and friction in future generation, 
Harmony is key::there is a saying in African  languages which says,  The roof is the cover of any house, so its extremely difficult to see what is happening inside the house.
●I don't support polygamy, it doesn't give a woman that, respect::that being as a woman,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love when women sincerely begins to leave a real life
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true I also support
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is wrong from my views.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Straight forward moreen u r a wound in serahs life.If she's da one who did this to u how would u feel.get uaself a different house n give serah some space.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah's eyes tells it all that she is not okay 
The man seems to love that home breaker more than serah
Didn't you notice that they were both wearing same shoes
Dematthew's first wife came to confess later on than she was not okay after hiding it for a long time
Serah too will come to confess one day
If the man was genuine enough,he would have confessed it to serah before anything else happened not waiting for serah to ask first about it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure'......... this behaviour of hiding a relationship to this extent is torture 😏😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I find Serah so cute
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless this family.. love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All in all, Cera is a grown woman and if she didn't want this arrangement she would have done something about it. They say they're happy.....I believe them. They are doing what many Kenyans do quietly. If this is evil, all the other arrangements however hidden are equally evil."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah she is not happy at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Soon he will get a 3rd woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,My message is to Maureen...Here in Uganda we have a good fellowship by Pr .Tom in mutundwe ...you need healing
q4sWUJxjc4g,To me Serah was weak and the bulldozer Abraham is not a good man
q4sWUJxjc4g,That breathing of Cera  summarizes all..both played ...do the thing get a baby and we are here to stay and the guy got the stamp.DONT TELL ME ITS OF GOOD WILL HERE.NOOOOOO THE GUY DIDNT WANT TO LOOSE ANY OR LET ANY GO...SELFISH HE WANT THEM BOTH SAME TIME.CERAH ITS ALL BY GODS GRACE SND THE SECOND CAME LEARNED READY TO PLAY ANGEL AND LIVE AN ANGEL.LET THEM LIVE HAPPILY.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1:45:35 If a woman told me what Cerah told Abraham, I would probably tear up, I would probably wipe my tears with a bag of cement, but they'd still be real tears"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I felt so sorry for Cera at this point.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@natalielimo1286 She's full of grace on another level
q4sWUJxjc4g,first wife hajaheal aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Bible clearly says in Genesis 2:24 that a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife  and they shall be one flesh. According to God's   blue print for  marriage consist of one husband and one wife.Humans have tried to redefine marriage  as   polyandry , Polygamy,Gay and Lesbian marriage and transgender marriage .But God's stand is what matters.Because in 2nd Timothy 3:1-4 says during the last days Men(humans) will be lovers of themselves and  pleasure more than lovers of God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is more beautiful ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! Abraham is so brave unlike many men where they would opt to hide everything yet it's happening. In my opinion if they are happy it's ok. It's their life n what they have chosen n they r happy. we ain't living in this life forever
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sending love to you Serah❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Githuri kimalamali😡😡na dugishonoka mukamo 🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nobody will ever receive a trophy or an award for enduring a man’s bs. To each their own.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mpango wa kando ni ndugu ya mganga na mchawi, 1st wife be very careful mpango wa kando ni mjanja na hupretend to be good"
q4sWUJxjc4g,these women are a very good example of feminine and submissive women. thats why they are so attractive to any man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can't understand this I really hope u are happy the way u say coz happiness is the key, Sera I salute u may God give keep you truly happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera you're one of a kind you endure the pain so much.. blessings unto you and your family ❤️❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the  most pejorative, barbaric, humiliating and disrespectful  behavior l have never heard of in this age and era...my dear Ceera,  stop sugarcoating betrayal and face reality out there!! Abraham is not worth  a husband nor a role model AT ALL!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's a beautiful interview. We all humans and nature pounds us differently. Let's respect their decisions 👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is pure pretence 
I wish serah to be interviewed alone to open her heart 
It is all written on her face she is not happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mollin why can't you see that you have done all-knowing hurting another woman? Abraham, you are a stupid greedy man who wants everything to himself hurting your respectful wife. Serah is still suffering silently and this is clear from her facial expression and deep breaths. There is no marriage, they are laughing and pretending to the camera. Mollin wait until a third I brought."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy was outlawed by the Catholic church in the year 1563 by the council of trent ..it's allowed in the bible , alcohol too ..Jesus would not have outlawed polygamy , he was a Jew and that was their culture..alcohol too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is what they call sister wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is very wise where's Cera as the first wife is very forgiving and Moureen is very respectful to Cera.i wish them well.Many couple's out there are living double lives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I was born and brought up in a polygamy family, life was very easy for my mothers and my father"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@kallon, I like such comments each and every family has their way of managing their affairs. we ought to appreciate such, like these families. Hongera for the comment."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wonderful testimony
q4sWUJxjc4g,People opposing this are western bain washed African
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let live together and enjoy this wonderful life that is giving to us by God almighty
q4sWUJxjc4g,👍👍👍👍for this family
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ether we like or not polygamy was here and will be here  is natural
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine it's not. Two wives are like a pot of witchcraft.. it was aGikuyu proverb and all these are aGikuyu. Know they worth.. hii upuzi siwezi kubalisha for me. I have grown in a polygamous family of three wives. It was all flowers growing up. The first wife died recently and let me tell you the things we are just knowing that we didn't know😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sara is a great woman,she is wonderful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't forget gay life is growing like a wild fire
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This culture of marrieding two or more is  coming back, u can not destroy culture. Culture is nature"
q4sWUJxjc4g,But this natural we African our culture is not going any where (history repeats it self
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These three people are adults, in sound mind and each has power and freedom to choose what they want. They decided to do this together but only time will tell. I think the two ladies should live separately so that respect can be achieved in the long run. It's not a crime to marry a second wife according to my opinion."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have never seen such man but cerah never give up you are a strong woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Heri huyu Abraham alifanya hivi na akamwoa, ikaisha hivi, and he has kept them together in one house, so he can't favor one than the other. Wengine matuire matharagia na different ladies and we have nothing to do. We are still there waiting God to do something for us"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow, I Enjoyed watching this Story , The Fact that they are All Honest to Each Other This Will Work Very Well, Both Ladies are Pure Heart and Very Humble.
Abraham Well Done for the Love and Support for Your kids ,  All The Best Guys Lots of Love. 😍😍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,i cant share my man let just say the truth .its so hard . -
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is what ruined my LOVE for my Dad. The world turned around when my mum died. She came pretending but later she showed her true picture.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish you people the best.We go through this life,it has no any problem if at all the two have decided ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very interesting story
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is the way these days.instead of a having a side chick
q4sWUJxjc4g,A third wife is coming
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes already amezaaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham ujue you are three men moureen has his cela has her own this is nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think both women are beautiful, nice and humble, but Maureen seems to be more outspoken than Serah. I don't think Maureen would have accepted Serah if she was the first wife. They, however seem to like each other as sisters or best friends. I can relate this story to the story of a white couple who bring in a 2nd woman to spice up their sexual life and they liked the vibe so much that they let her stay for good. Let's not forget that about 80% of all married men, especially African men are having some sort of happiness outside their marital homes with other women. Even though I can't be in the shoes of either of these women, I hope they continue to live happily and raise their children up together. I also hope Abraham doesn't disappoint them by having other women, which I already suspect him to be doing 😉. Polygamy and extra marital affairs are everywhere guys, even in advanced world, so don't judge them too much."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter how much we sugar coat this issue. Sin is a sin.Cerah had no choice but to accept Maureen since in the first place Abraham had decided to keep her in his life without any apology.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God see you through cera you're a strong lady love is not easy to share
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen let's hope your little girl won't pay for what you did to Cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Come on leave the kids out of this....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a mum to two daughters, may this never be their portion. Women empowerment still needs to be emphasized. May God grant the necessary wisdom to parents of girls to equip them so that they don't have to go through this. Cerah, May you find happiness and fullness in God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,AMEN 🙏🏾
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm guessing women empowerment until it starts controlling and restricting what a man can do?

No matter how much women are empowered men will always be polygynous and its their right. A man is not a woman's personal possession

You better tell your daughters the facts before you deceive them about how men operate and sell them a fantasy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What happens if the guy meets a 3rd woman of whom he gets attracted? The ladies seem contented with the current arrangement, but Mwangi seems like mtu wa kuhanyahanya hapa na pale. For now, all the best to all of them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You think so, but 2 years is not an experience to tell us.
You have just started my friend."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They seem to get along alright! Can we all learn to get along??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Maureen are horrible. must you move in ceerah s house? it's fake these women saying that they are friends. Friends with cowives? never heard off..
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah still hurts from her voice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pretence, I prày he doesn't bring the third,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are pretending, personally I don't condorn polygamy, it's like they're jùst postponding a problem"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People are naturally selfish Abraham is inlove with maureen Serah is inove with Abraham, Abraham knows  Cerah is Loyal to him but maureen is the spice.....what am i saying to each their own"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah
is not comfortable at all ni vile alishindwa kenye atafanya"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The happiness of a woman is thru face cerah take hearrt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you guys feel sorry for Sera, me I feel sorry for the 2nd wife, she is being played and used coz i think Sera uses her as a helper"
q4sWUJxjc4g,why deceiving one self
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this is not polygamy
 This started with cheating."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the guy love the second wife more than the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygyny is not healthy and women involved should realise themselves and come out. Most men are selfish to sleep with different women to satisfy their sexual desires. Cera the first wife is not very happy inside but she is not strong enough to walk out. This man will definitely bring in a third wife Cera. Maureen doesn't loose anything because she is the one sharing Cera's husband. It is her own interest to comply  and play the good woman so that she can maintain her acceptance in the marriage. Maureen I suggest you get your own husband and let Cera enjoy her marriage.  I pity Cera because she is weak and soft and I don't think she can stand up to Maureen. I wish you the best Cera and I wish you happiness from within.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God always bless Cerah she is a good woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah we love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s clear that Abraham leans on Maureen side quit a lot . It’s clear after 8 years he needed something to spice it up . Serah looks realy Reserved and it must be the reason why….
q4sWUJxjc4g,We need to have such kind of men and ladies too.....this is so encouraging.May God continue guiding and protecting this family.😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how everyone wants to paint it right. For me, Maureen is a glorified Sidechick."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa ni grace tu...sina words
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love both ladies. I pray for Sarah to keep on and be strong 🙏🏿
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My  question is how do you guys go on about sex 🤔,?Do you have a calendar, does the man satisfy you or he saves the energy for the  other woman?????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wonderful 👏 story ❤.    As Muslims that's what our religion 👍 approved 👌 alhamdu lillah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jesus is the way the truth and life. Accept him today
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera hayuko happy but ni karembo  she don't deserve this
q4sWUJxjc4g,It should be called polyamory.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham should learn to never go out for coffee with any other woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sweet story; the hiding and cheating we see with fake monogamy is so much worse than this. Blessings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@karis, very true"
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,But I think polygamy reduces the number of single mothers . It's good
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Imagine the second wife reading the comments here, she'll be in tears"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Three is a crowd..the second wife, will always be the other woman...mabakishishi 😕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haiyae abraham my customer
q4sWUJxjc4g,He betrayed his wife no matter how he sugarcoats the story. And I'll quit. I can't continue watching.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you deserve better, Sarah you deserve better, Sarah you deserve some who can love you .... aki inaniumaaa as if is me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy isn't for me, my man is mine the day he step out is gone ....and i ain't religious ...i won't share nooooooooooo"
q4sWUJxjc4g,They look alike ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,He love moreen if he loved the first one he wouldn't looked anywhere else
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy isn't real ....is to very feminine ...no wonder they can cope
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sasa hii ya same house? Ama kuna threesome pia?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Oh God 🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to Sarah.. Lynn l love you...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen you are blessed 🙌 😇 keep going
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera she is very clever 👏 and humbled
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sometimes God brings an Angle in the family and because of wiiru most people never noticed them.
Thanx Sera for appreciating moreen she is a blessings to this 👪 
Kidos to Sera thanx for welcoming her to your family.
Thanx Abraham for your courage your are blessed two btiful 👧  peda nyinyi sana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,European made us believe that marrying two wife's is a sin but marrying ur fellow man is human rights.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Did Abraham paid bride price for both ladies?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Disclaimer: I am from the west. So my perspective is from that lens. I haven't made it too far into the interview but it seems that there is a traditional element in which the preservation of family is highly valued. However, there also seems to be a manipulation of this cultural paradigm to achieve a selfish end rooted in ownership and chauvinism. He hid his acts. He told Maureen he wasnt going to leave his kid. She said he gets was he wants. Sounds like neither of them had a choice. He coerced or convinced them both. I'm not a fan of polygyny. It truly doesn't seem fair. And research indicates many women regardless of wife order experience adverse psychological harm. So do the kids. There are few that work well. It could be exposure to western ideology but I am not sure. I abhor the practice even as a Muslim. I actually probably hate men now as a result of listening to men discuss this bs as it seems rooted in selfishness and arrogance. However, if they find its working, I am no one. I've seen where it does work and if they're at peace, I wish them well. But ew."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its a pity.  You cant be happy here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is older than Sarah wanaume mkioa second wife si mtafute gachugwa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"so Cerah loves her husband unconditionally????like hiyo part Maureen says that Cerah alimwangalia kutoka juu moaka chini, maybe she was wondering "" what does she have that I don't""..............anyway.....as long as she is happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope Cerah has a secret lover
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing about this shall ever work, nothing I repeat nothing this guy has egoistic character you can tell how sarah says she had to wait for him to get in a good mood to tell him he was cheating am telling you this guy will get another woman one-day he is not yet done

2, he is not letting the first woman speak,he is riding on there insecurities"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Okay, so I want something like this but all three of us should be totally in board with it. Not polygamy, more like polyamourous. Not the guy having a chile on the side but the three of us being in it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham ur a manipulator, Maureen in the end u will have to find ur own marriage, Cera is the covenant wife ,as a psychologist I think Sera gave up on u ,and no love for u any more Abraham the betray got her in a shock shes not out yet"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Coated lies,no way a woman can be happy with a woman that has taken away her happiness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bt cerah for the sake of ua kinds be strong mama
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves molyne
q4sWUJxjc4g,looking at the comments ..people are very unkind. Wishing Cerah to leave her beautiful family. The husband family is now much stronger with his two beautiful and strong women that can lean on each other. Were that all men were so lucky. Cerah  is the wisest of women. She understands that she is the root and foundation of her family and must stand strong against the haters. What God has put together may no man able to destroy. To Maureen stay strong do not become the weak link in the chain.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's how he avoids to say cerah name and refers to her as you, she wueh🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Did we all miss the part where the guy says, cerah hakuwa amemkosea akashangaa ""Sasa huyu hajanikosea nla bla bla"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,You should thank God for the way he has made you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceta in agony pain God help her as the first wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this.its very lovely
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is with because of guilty and self bity after they explain how they met with second wife I feel this was bcz of the supply's  he is so materialistic and the second wife was desperate for a husband he doesn't love cerah he is in love with the second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are fornicating with each other,  Bible made it clear that God hate an adulterous with perfect hatred...i don't care how they love themselves"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera isn't happy Morin was forced down her throat n I just hate the feeling Abraham is proud eti he wasn't letting Morin go
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a man, so many lessons learned from Abraham"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nimekwama kwa 'I saw her shed a tear'😭😭wooi Cerah you clearly didn't have a choice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I keep watching this episode. Cerah was expecting her second child when she came to know of Maureen. At this moment, I would want to imagine she was helpless with no other option apart from tolerating the two. By the time a man tells you he has extra marital affairs and he seems to shield the third party, one of the reasons is that he doesn't mind losing you. She loved Abraham so much that she wanted his full attention, that is why she had to shift at one point to the extent of allowing this woman who is dividing his attention to move in and live with them. Maureen is a home wrecker, she went ahead to date a married man (even when she knew) and conceived. Maureen will always be displaced. Cera is the rightful wife before God. Her survival will depend on Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No from what I see..cera was not forced to do this.she is benefiting from having Maureen around and Maureen is happy to have cera too.she is making lemonade out of the so called lemons
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@edithmburu3580 I believe your thinking is after they have settled. My thinking is the process before and after. You can imagine your husband lying and giving petty excuses for sleeping out. One of them being the distance to town. You try to seal the loophole by moving closer to town. Then you think you are done only for you to find out through your child that he has impregnated another woman. And now it clicks that he has been having an extramarital affair, the reason why he has been sleeping out. Worse still, the situation cannot be done away with since a child is involved. That means all your lives are intertwined with this other woman. You confront him and he says that the woman is going nowhere. Women generally are territorial. The fact that Cera accepted this another woman purely pokes holes in her life. And now your thinking comes in."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Linda stop making up stories... we all make mistakes and sometimes takes two or three to correct them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@lutufyodixon9997 so which stories am I making up? Who said no one doesn't make mistake? For your information, there is a difference between a mistake and an intentional wrongdoing!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@lindachebet7719  
You aren't a man to have that imagination... there are mistakes done by women that men should just understand than going straight into claiming it's intentional 

Mapenzi comes unintentional most of the time, so let's not be too much judgemental to our spouses as long as they come back to their shells and act to correct what seems to be a mistake in that way. 

Having two wives is not wrong in the eyes of us men. We can love as many as they present themselves before our eyes. 

Stop judging him too much while men nowadays takes care kids who aren't his own biologically. 

Marriages aren't Perfect all the time. It's our job to come in and cover the gap"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Uz are all shit are you fucking them too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is such a beautiful lady.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No man can love two people at the same time.... Even God loves others than others.....He loves one and likes one or he loves none, he's yet to fall in love....If men will be truthful to themselves and stop deceiving people's daughters because of their selfishness.... They know what I just texted is a fact!!! He will definitely love one and just like the other... it's very clear he loves the second wife more....The bible said the worse thing to happen to woman is for her  husband to love someone else....I will quietly walk out of this marriage and leave the second wife and him in peace.The first wife is clearly not happy, she is pretending with all the deep breath...why kill yourself over a man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah.. we’ll pray for you. Lord knows these two are waiting for you to move out😢.. he made it clear he’s not leaving her and it was the “looking beyond love” comment. Sis it will be well🙏🏽..  

Sometimes we need to know when love is lost and when to move on🙏🏽"
q4sWUJxjc4g,That family is happy. You get married first
q4sWUJxjc4g,"he just loves both women. As long as the women accept this situation it is easy for the man. If Sara were to leave, the man would be devastated because he loves her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The holiest woman Sarah couldn't bare it with Hagai the one she chose herself... Dear God hear your children
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah so beautiful and calm.. I hope she can one day love herself more and know her worth.That man isn't worth it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,That's according to you not her?
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is not worth of heartache at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@ochiengkepher7477honey she is a human, what woman would love to share one thing that’s meant to never share. Your husband is never for sharing 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is coming back into our society in unequalled measure...the earlier  women agree, the better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,​@@kjoo3360 very True.
q4sWUJxjc4g,One man one woman ...period...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Marriages are hard n why sometimes they break down its because you were not the right match in the first place,sometimes even being a first wife dont always mean that you have settled with the Man who deserved you,lets learn to be strong n open minded with or without kids in the marriage,there men out there who dont mind marrying women with previous marriage kids cause they very much understand that kids are innocent n kids are a blessing n finally that young kids are always safer with their mothers n not stepmothers,May God heal Cera cause she don't sound happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"https://youtu.be/mINsItjPiKc This vedeo has some information about God judgement on all marriages that are not from God in the next 12, months,Women must be strong n ready to move on,most importantly make sure you have ur own money cause when judgement comes n it crumbles then you dont need to part away empty handed,Some men dont mind women with kids as long as they have a good career or business to support the family requirements"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So Mr Abraham, is this what you would want for your daughters? You know, It 's only in Kenya that we find these young selfish brats of young men who think they are very smart.  The way the second wife came, the third and fourth are on the way, as you show us you're  not  able to have much self control .  You have very weak morals and I just wish you can share your wife with another man, then you can taste the bitter pills."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Lynn
This Moreen lady lucks self control 

You see a baby and still she is waiting to hear from the man

I doubt this family and I see death coming soon

Nothing to do with values never be fooled
That is all lustful marriage 
No one is married since 2012
She would have walked away and avoid coffee ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am breaking down honestly 💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hehe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Key word is, Moreen isn't going anywhere!!! Hoo cyber hugs sera😔😔🥲🥲 seems this man loves Moreen more than sera. Sera brought in Moreen to have peace in their home"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At some point Abraham said he married moreen because they were not in good terms with Cera,at some other point moreen said she knew Abraham was married, very contradictory story.pole sana Cera God still loves you more."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love it is so much better
q4sWUJxjc4g,If am Serah i can't even finish this so called interview seeing my man telling how he used to cheat on me🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Olemwa 😏😏😏😏😏 as a proud Ugandan ebyo tetubukola dia afazaali nkuloga 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If this was a Moslem channel, it wd teach the volumes.
But from the Christian point of view, it's disturbing!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen got into this with 100%  knowledge.
After she got the truth that he is married, she wd hv left immediately.

But her going on to accept getting pregnant for Abraham, knowing his marital status, doesn't show her being an honest friend whom Cerah terms her.

If she was Cerah, wd she take that in?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To me, I strongly believe that what attracted him to these ladies isn't strong enough.
He said, look at both of them, they are light!!!
It's his weakness???

Then he talks about Sarah having high heels!!!
These reasons don't sound solid.
How many beautiful, brown ladies are out there? How about putting on heels?
There are so many.
What am trying to say?

He might find many other brown galz, putting on heels, interprenuers, soft spoken, kind, etc.

Those above given reasons, doesn't give him reason to hv 2wives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes to Serah.   Her poise shows she still hurts but has no choice.  Maureen and Abraham work together lol.  Anyway it is your choice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This interview looks rehearsed. Cera is hurting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Okay soooo a man cheated ..on his wife and decided to call it a polygamous rship....this lady moureen. Keeps on saying i felt guilty for cerah..she is like cerah cerah cerah knowing very well she opened her legs to a married man...it takes two to tango....women do not settle fr this madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1Cerah is hurting.
2.Abraham fell out with  Cerah and has  fallen in love with Moureen  
3.Moureen and Abraham are new lovers
4.Abraham has sympathy love for CErah and some guilt guided behaviour towards her (Not love) 
5.Moreen will forever live with guilt as a woman in this society but deep down she is selfishly letting her feelings guide her.
5.Moureen will forever struggle to get the likes and acceptance from the society but one thing she knows is that Abraham loves her  more I mean who doesnt want to be loved.
6.Parting shot for my ladies ; Never let a man tell or show you twice that he doesnt love you no more aaaaand women make sure the man loves you more than you love him..you are the prize.
7.Cerah is hurting once again depression and hurt come in many ways you can see hurt through laughter and calm dont be fooled and to b honest Abraham knows this and thts why he is giving her sympathy love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The reason this relationship is working is because of cerah she is the main bond 
If she decides to be angry the whole relationship between the three will go haywire
So much respect to cerah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly 😢 see now there no where to be seen.... I think the same 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"be honest, Cera had no choice when she learned about moureen. How could Cera leave a home she has build from scratch?? From rental to home owner then all of a sudden a parasite from nowhere invades your home...... Moureen just know that Karma is a bitch, you might pretend to be happy but as long a you have a daughter... think twice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeh I'm  so heartbroken 💔.I wish  cerah could  love herself  enough 🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,"GOATWIVES ARE SO BITTER HERE,,, if these two ladies agreed to stay in one house then your harsh comments are not needed let them enjoy to the fullest and am happy for them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh my.. that part where she confronted him about Maureen and his response.. Lord that was a sign of an entitled man.. Lord his response of telling her he loves Maureen and will never leave her is the most heart wrenching thing anyone could tell his wife in such a situation. Cerah if you are listening or reading this comment, Abraham does not love you. Period! You could see how much fun he is having to talking about two women who are holding unto him like a parasite... No romantic emotion when he talks about his wife Cerah... Oh Cerah...you had to accept all these so to have Him!... You are worth more...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I felt the same!!!
Those answers to Cerah were too harsh!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not sure what this story is teaching our toung generations. It should be codenmed. The value of the family must be sustained beyond  work ethics  . Hope my daughter will never  have to go through this. Sera seem a very humble woman.  Men need to have self control.  How do they do romance with their kids in the same house especially when they grow to be teenagers
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn Ngugi, your level of questiomare interview is of high level"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen should go look for her own. THAT'S CERA'S HUSBAND.  HAKI. CERA WAS FORCED INTO THIS BY CIRCUMSTANCES
q4sWUJxjc4g,"GOING ON DATES WITH SOMEONE'S HUSBAND AND PRETENDING THAT SOMETHING WILL NOT COME OUT OF IT, AND THIS MAN PRETENDING THAT SARAH WAS NOT COMMUNICATING WELL WITH HIM WAS JUST A STUPID EXCUSE WE. THIS TWO SINNED AGAINST SARAH. ONLY BECAUSE SARA IS CALM. HAKI  NYINYI. SARA NIKUVUMILIA AMEVUMILIA TU. HE SAYS HE HAD NO INTENTION O MATHATHARAU, YET ALIKUWA AMESHAMWONYESHA MATHARAU BY STEPPING OUTSIDE YOUR MARRIAGE"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have enjoyed watching this story....thank you for being honest to each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,ABRAHAM IS THE MOST SELFISH AND UNGRATEFUL MAN I JUST SAW. SARAH ANAVUMILIA TU KUKUA MKE COZ SHE'S GOT NO NERVE FOR PLAN B.. NO WOMAN WANTS TO SHARE A HUSBAND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY STARTED FROM NOTHING...HALAFU ULETEWE CO-WIFE BAADAYE JUST BECOZ U ARE CALM.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not normal...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ipo siku Sera atazungumza.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish them all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Though these guy is very sharp ? wise. the reason he has managed them. cool and corrected.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera just say the truth. Don't hurt inside while trying to make one happy. These two should be very careful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueh! ,it’s too hot under this blanket🤔. Some decisions are tough to make, maneuvering around that triangle is a lot tricky but it is what it is. 😊Y’all feel me?!🥰🫡Power & Cheers to Cerah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is walking dark red flag. The way he interrupts Cera and insists on calling her Sarah even after she has expressed discomfort....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Unbelievable! got glued nonstop for close to 2 hours.  A very good interview Lynn. Long live Abraham's Empire 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati ""God's doing""??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can feel the first lady. The pain is too much 🥲🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sorry
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pls one language so we can understand the story  well mixtin two language together
q4sWUJxjc4g,Na hata cerah ndiye mrembo sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ni makosa sana kuingililia ndoa ya mtu, Maureen ulifanya vibaya sana and I pity u,,,usifikirie cerah ako comfortable wwe, unaeza aje realise mtu akona familia na bdo unakubali kupelekwa date,,,I love u cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,A Man Can Have Up To Four Wives And It's Cool...
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife isn't happy inside
q4sWUJxjc4g,Toka hiyo Boma ya Sera Ghasia
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife is more cutter than the 2nd one. Sorry for that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not into polygamy neither do I want to promote it but this couple appear happy, kind, respectful, gentle n loving than most monogamy families where the husband is cheating n having multiple partners outside been a universal donar who leaves his kid aimlessly n does not take care of responsibilities n yet pretend to hav one wife. Atlist Abraham is taking care of his responsibilities the kid's n the wives r wel taken care of Selah n Maureen r happy as the queens they deserve n am sure this is one of the most happiest family n the 3 heads r proving to be better than one. To the Abraham's family keep the love growing n always remain united am sure u wil go far. Most of us making bad comments r motivated by jealousy cause even we can't hold one piece together like u do. All the best."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Value each other and prevent the spread of wrong decision from outside 📌
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can't stand this , even if am the first wife"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is trying to justify her foolishness.. Abraham is just manipulative
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love Serah, she looks young and  beautiful, Ibrahim you cannot love two the same, the bible says  you will love one and hate the other."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't try this guys😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is simply stupid.
I'm glad I watched it to the point of realizing this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After done deal, ‘what about Sarah?’ You should have consider her from the day you were aware that her husband is sleeping with you instead of you both hiding it from her until baby comes!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is not a laughing matter, when it comes to Abraham lying to the wife about not picking phone and coming late. He’s selfish and still young. I know he will go for another wife when these two grow older. Men always betray their wives in these aspect. You would have regretted if your wife at home was giving you problems. Kudos to Sarah. Good luck"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, was it from beginning you told Sarah you will marry another wife or when you saw Maureen and you think you like her?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I want to ask Abraham what he’s lacking that makes him go for second wife?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If sera was really a good woman to you, then what else made you look for Maureen???????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Selfishness!!! The way he answered her on the first confrontation!!!

It's where I realised that he didn't love or care about Cerah more.
Maureen was in the picture as the beloved,
One who will not be chucked or forsaken!!!
So, Cerah had to accept it!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham I love your confidence bro! Be strong for the family. If you crumble the whole family will follow. Keep on striving.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen and seera don't worry about peoples' suggestions. You just exercise what make you happy 😊.  Keep up the togetherness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@haj, I fully support ur gesture. let them not worry about what people say, it's their decision to love this man and stay in the same house. more blessings."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Life is what you make it. If you guys are happy and God is on your side, nothing else matters"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really wanted to love this interview and lifestyle but there is something that looks a bit forced, hopefully it’s just in my head… I wish them happiness 🌻"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am happy for all of them. It is not new for us. I wish you well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham I don't think you have any good advice you can give about marriage don't let the devil yes you
q4sWUJxjc4g,You manvyou already spoiling your kids and our kids and the community at large
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is so humble.Hugs mummy♥️♥️
q4sWUJxjc4g,But very tomenting for her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you need Jesus in your life and you know that God did not take 2ribs from a man it was only one rib so Maureen you need to find your own husband.  My friend hell is real and heaven as well . You will never be happy in that marriage this is the truth. Just get you self together and move out of Cera home because in are in fornication . God is not happy with you at all that man is alair  and always fear God not man. It's not too late
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is not happy at all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Surely cera looked so miserable May the joy and peace of our Heavenly Father help you darling.if pretense on set was a person.
Cera is number one.
Secondly there is nothing under the sun that will change or out do Gods word 
Everything will come to pass but his word will never.
He commanded Man to have one woman and makes them one body.so MOREEN my darling i don't know but the is still hope for you.
Ur such a beautiful sweet soul leave Abraham and Cera to enjoy their marriage.
The lord will also bless you with your own happiness of marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is likely to cheat on them. I realized he's like a narcissist he doesn't want her to talk.  Cerah be prepared for worst. May God fight for your marriage. May God open your eyes to pray for your family. God created a man and a women the third one is death. Cerah you're beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This happens when women lost their value, insecurity and tolerate disrespect from men. Having children with a man is not a reason to stay in a turbulence marriage. 
Cera , you can do better than this. You are comfortable but not happy. Don’t settle for this. If this man love you, he shouldn’t have taken a second wife. 
This man is very manipulative, he is using you both for his own self gratification. 
Both women are his property. ( Abraham’s empire). He refers to them as a “parcel”. 
Third wife is on the way😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wonderful couples,God bless u guys moo,very inspiring"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is very unhappy but pretending to be happy. Poor girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,A bomb is about to explode
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't even comprehend how Maureen is ready to answer all questions
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nikaa ndio wa kwanza
q4sWUJxjc4g,exactly my point
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera, I can't speak for you but listening to your few comments n how you sigh as you breathe I feel there's a lot in your heart. I just pray to God that one day you will have the courage to face your own fears and for yourself n the kids. You know this your husband has broken your trust by this n it is not easy to stomach n live with it. Am just thinking of how you survive around them haki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man will soon or later add another ""chicken"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a very stupid guy!!!God forbid to find myself in such a situation.If you fall in love while still in a relationship you should respect yourself and focus on the new rship,working out how to support your children with your previous spouse.A very selfish guy!!!He will never stop..coz they have supported it already!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How do they handle disagreements? This is just sbsurd
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well if she was able to hide her low moods for a whole month before she asked who Maureen is, then it could be she's putting on a face right now 🤔. My opinion tho. This is sad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have watched this Soo keenly and there's some spiritual coincidence here.this reminds me of the story of Sara formerly known as sera and Abraham in the bible. Sera tells Abraham to go get himself another woman who can bore him a child but even if Sarah had consented to Abraham getting another woman, God did NOT!! because Sarah was a woman of promise,so relating to this,even though cera tries to accept everything,what does God have to say that I leave it to God to judge"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Fear this men with side burns. Hatari kwa usalama, community husband. Once a cheat, always a cheat. Same story happened to my friend, the second wife played smart,, 4 yrs down the line separation was huge after the man retired. Later Left with the first wipe. Maureen you did wrong mbele ya Mungu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can't blame him he's living upto his name Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,#LynnNgugi did you ask them whether its a threesome or its one at a time🤭both are very cute by the way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are not building a home it is broken. It's just a matter of time
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you are a home wrecker. Shame on you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"serah  was betrayed not just by her husband but also his family. This woman needs to be given a platform to speak. I hate it so much when she speaks and they laugh, they are covering up something. They do not want her to fully reveal her emotions and feelings. They are gaslighting her and minimizing her pain!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I thought I was the only one who saw that...I mean laughing when she speaks though there is nothing to laugh at..
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is selfish and doesn’t even consider the pain he caused
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love Lynn!
q4sWUJxjc4g,“Her level of calmness would not allow things to escalate.” He took advantage of her calmness and kindness. Shame
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is the husband thanking Maureen and applauding her for anything! What is this???? Serah you can do alone. You are beautiful and strong. Educate yourself about narcissistic abuse. Manipulation and gaslighting is what is happening in this home.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is one thing have learnt here, Abraham  loved serah's heel shoes and how he could buy skuma in their grocery, then he invited her to his place then the girl did the cleanness , washing  she was told not to go and that's how she got married just in a short run. The man hakupenda serah as the love of his life, he just loved her calmness,politeness cleanness and not the apple of his eye. Then from there in the long run he got that mongoroid Maureen  and loved her genuinely as the love of his life that he can even give excuses it's raining, that he can stay with Maureen until Maureen pushed him to go home to see the wife. My opinion though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Trueeeeeee
q4sWUJxjc4g,This!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah may God give you peace bcz it is not easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even if Cera is happy there is stage in the story I have cried
But Ni sawa ,siamini nikiambiwa ,sikufuzi......you better fukuza haki ilack words anyway lakini kaeni tu hata sisi twachezwa hata kaa hajaletewa home"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I hate men! Cera was cornered into accepting. Maureen you're not a good person
q4sWUJxjc4g,The whole Abraham speech is so cringeworthy!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The second  person  is always an intruder, hope one day cerah will speak up her mind,this is just bad.i wish cerah well as she cope up with everything ❤."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter how much u explain urself  maureen ur a home wrecker....period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you are in my prayers. It's not easy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,yan wewe lynn unafaa kuwa mwalimu jamani unavyoongea tuu unaweza kufundisha mwanafunz akaelewa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why do women agree to these things because no man will ever do this. Polygamous families are toxic and the children get damaged. The only person who wins is the selfish husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a wicked guy! Do you really feel for Sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I can’t stop laughing as this interview is a vibe you even show how you could reacted if you were cerah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s clear that once a man have more than one wife it means he will never be satisfied but let them continue being patient to one another but in the hearts nothing like pure .thank you lyn
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham cheated on his wife and it's wrong. Period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen pls do not promote polygamy.when you new that he was married you should have stopped seeing him.you don't have enough faith in god that's why you did it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,much love for both women
q4sWUJxjc4g,If the so called Abraham dies God forbid....the so called Maureen will be in a big mess.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A Husband and a wife represent one GOD and one Church .""you shall not commit adultry"" thus sayeth the Lord .This kind of lifestyle teaches only greed ,Lust ,worldliness it does't teach Godliness , My brother i hope you repent and follow Jesus .Even though the woman did'nt care , to us real women ,this is simply emotional abuse to us and our children .It is sooo degrading period . My message to young girls please DO NOT accept this kind of lifestyle ever."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To Maureen, as innocent as you would like to sound, please reconsider your decision."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a youtube inlaw, this drama must come to an end in Jesus name. Maureen, please go get yourself a proper husband , and Mwangi, stop hurting Cerah. Thank you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i feel sorry for Serah,the pain is all over her face"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A cheater, manipulator a big fisi in the name of lovable nd convincing nway my opinion it good it end up well on this family my prayers to your family.. Polygamy is allowed but to go all those years with a rlshp is darkness... betrayed Ceera much love for you guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the man he is a witch he bewitched them😂 that part is not to be shared
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Disadvantage of having a good heart ,,u just trust without making decisions...love u cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would be proud to be in such a relationship than move from one to the other.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacha mambo mingi si rahisi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Go easy on Maureen guys!, let he who is without sin!, cast the first stone!, They have a beautiful Family so let’s wish them well. Most of you are from colonial discombobulations and you forgetting about your traditions. Polygamy is an African tradition that was vilified by Europeans to control our population, get it right."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn love the way you ask questions in a  smart way
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I can see is the first wife is not healed yet. They are all jst living a lie n they are still trying to convince themselves that they are happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is pure nonsense. Sad indeed😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes you what kind of friend are you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Because she was eying you

q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham found the love of his life after he had already married. I don't think Abraham could have married a second time should he have known Maureen first
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't finish the story hugs to you cerah may you find the courage to move on pain has been hidden in your smile .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham I wish u the best with your family but I feel sorry for Cera sharing a man has never been easy.It even failed for prophet Ibrahim and it took God's intervention.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am so proud of this family! Abraham didn’t have to hide and punish the other kid’s love for the sake of Sarah happiness, instead he brought them all together! Most men are hiding out there what the they are doing. Mipango ya Kando!!!! Kudos to you guys and for those women who think their husbands are trustworthy because they come home everyday good luck to you! Cheers"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy has been legalised in 🇰🇪  and in the African culture its acceptable however society has not thought through the implementation of it in this modern society.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is as old as anything... I absolutely love people who live outside the norm. People who know what they like and don't let society dictate how they should live. They look happy and wishing them nothing but the best in this thing called life. It's hard already without having people telling you how to live it. Beautiful family ❣️🥰💕

q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@freweinigebregzabher6022 don't 🐲 the of Jesus here read the bible properly, Joseph his father had another wife, no where polygamy is condemned in the holy bible nor in the Koran  or in any African tradition. This mentality of one man one wife for the Europeans and their demented culture. As long as a man can provide leadership and unbiased love to his wives there is nothing wrong with having more than one wife. Here it's not a matter of material wealth but humility and intelligence, women are capable of being self reliant with proper support and guidance from the husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@freweinigebregzabher6022 😂😂😂 clearly you are reading the wrong bible and in anyway, he is your saviour, not mine...."

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a beautiful story I must say. We cannot shy away rrom the fact that polygamy is part of our tradition and culture as long as it is done in a dignified and respectable manner. I respect Cerah. What a wise woman. She had to make a wise decision to keep her marriage intact.  Such a beautiful family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmmmmmh mchi

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I disagree polygmay it's unhealthy ,very wrong ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When he said he was defensive I thought, automatic narcissist. He made his feelings more important than his although he caused all the pain and hurt. Destroyed that woman's life then had the nerve to get angry and worried. Why not feel that way before talking to the other woman? As if she doesn't have feelings! It's got to be narcissistic to ignore the feelings you abandon when you talk to another person as if they are your wife. She is greedy (the other woman) and selfish. It's easy to hurt someone but when it happens to you, you're crushed like whyyyy did this happen to me. She deserved internal death because evil is evil and you know you're doing wrong but walk over the feelings like God isn't watching.  Who cares how lovable that snake is"

But believe you me, when the real tests and challenges of life start, i doubt whether the foundation will hold! Looks like a shaky one for me!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,May God never allow this to happen to me .such a manipulative man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sorry but I feel Abraham is playing with these two ladies.....but of course that's my opinion

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I admire  the three of you. I particularly  hail Cera, she is the foundation  of that home, her heart is opened with acceptance and Moreen reciprocated it by being respectful and loving.  Be rest assured you are not doing  anything  wrong, you are not against Bible teaching, unless  Abraham  is a Church  elder (1 Tim 3:2, 1 Tim 3:12 & Titus1:16) are the only places that the Bible  EXPLICITLY spoke against polygamy; and even that if the man is a CHURCH ELDER. Any other scripture that anyone will quote is Just by IMPLICATION and not that the Bible  spoke against polygamy DIRECTLY.  So, for those making all those annoying comments  in the name of ""Christianity""  stop lying to people. Allow these ones enjoy  their union in peace."

Very soon he might bring in another 3rd or 4th wife. By the time he turns 50, we don't know what will happen. May God help him, forgive him for causing emotional pain to those two ladies."

Maureen, allow God to work in your life, and He will give you your own husband.  Otherwise take advantage of a humble Cerah because she is a humble woman but to you is it a curse because Abraham & Cerah are in covenant.  Maureen, you are so beautiful to be used as a shame. Repent and go out of another woman's marriage. May God help you beautiful Maureen. Abraham will one day leave you in pain and you will then understand how much pain you caused the innocent Cerah."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham sent away hagai and the son, to finally have peace with Sarah.  No matter how you guys sugar coat it it's not bibilicaly right."
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God bless your family. There's nothing wrong with polygamy as long the man balances and treats his wife equally. I said wife because even if they are 10 God recognizes them as his wife.. the same way Christ is the husband of the church ( many membered body). Respect the man and let the man love his wife.

This man had the gut to tell me he loves me n was willing to make me his second wife. It's sad when you have develop feelings for a person n realize he has someone but it's worth it letting him go... U can't create your happiness by making another woman sad. This is a selfish man. Don't forget he said he has problem with light skin women.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the look of things , Sarah's statement has a deep meaning, God never allow polygamy he created a man and took 1 rib from the man not  2 ribs man stop mentioning God here polygamy was brought up as a result of sin and it will remain sin forever.i had a certain statements that ""if you have decided to join us come it's not easy ""Sara told mourine ,still water will always run deep 🚶🚶"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No first wife should have to tell such a tale...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeuh🙌🏾
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God never says he's unhappy against a man having two wives and is able to take care of them. The plagiarized Eurocentric  bible that many Africans are reading now  is beclouding their sense of reasoning from our african culture. The imported Euroamerican life style many african ladies  and some men want to adopt, hence,  forgetting our  culture and traditional values makes them call it """"Polygamy"""", there's no such thing as Polygamy in our african languages,  most of you here are reasoning from an European emotional point and not from a logic and africanologic state. Our forefathers practice these, why do most of you now condemned it?
Would you have preferred for her to remain a sidechic instead of a wife?
Now, Chinese people married their cousins, would you judge them, is it bad from our side? Yes, do they demonize it,  No, it's part of their culture.  Different people, different ways of practicing and doing things. 
Please, leave the Euroamerican culture for them, do not try to be Africans and Europeans at the same time or being European in the melanated body of an African. 
We want to throw away our culture, our concept of God as understood by our uncestors, our values, our foods but adopt European and Chinese foods,  our spirituality....etc 
You cannot be respected as a civilization if you continue on this path. 
Learn to Embrace what is uniquely yours and will achieve great.
There's a lot of knowledge about why our uncestors where adopting many wives, our remaining Kings are still practicing this tradition up till now. Some of you must Educate yourselves if you care to know more.... 
Our Foremothers or female uncestors never had any issues with what you all call today ""Polygamy"" there was nothing like Polygamy. Men and Kings have and had different wives and treated each other like sisters but many african women today are in communion with a different kind of spirit that has tempered with their brains, they have lost the sense of sisterhood. Wickedness, Ego and Selfishness has taken over the spirit person within."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men require chastity and loyalty from women but will trade in that chastity for another woman in a flash. The stunning thing to me is that they don't consider that act betrayal. In my opinion he betrayed his wife and still demanded loyalty from her. The part that's difficult is that children are now involved and their needs supersede those of the adults involved. Some people blame single mothers for the breakdown of the family unit but surely, how can one demand that a woman stay in a situation like this when that wasn't part of their original covenant of marriage. The day he began dating Maureen is the day HE broke the covenant. This is just astounding. If this new family works for them, I support it regardless of my feelings about it."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nikamwingiza kwa chama, I programmed chama yake ikue Saturday, so that before we go out, akue amelipa chama. We started investing and here we are 😭😭😭cera oh beautiful cera 😭😭😭. Cera build this man and when money started coming in, he started seeing the beauty in other women 😢. May God bless cera with a faithful man who will treat her like a queen she is"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine. Maureen u r the death in this marriage. Enda huko home wrecker
q4sWUJxjc4g,well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't think like you
q4sWUJxjc4g,​@ochiengkepher7477  how will you feel if your daughter works so hard in life plus your support (including financial) then later another woman scoops the cream..?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueh!!!I Kent,let's not lie to each other.Cerahs heart is still heavy,I can feel it.She is just a calm woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am even fearing dating 😌😌😌😌alafu nipate mwanaume kama huyu .... 😒 Wtf
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Bible says one wife one husband period.........the bible says we're free do to anything we want to but  we will be judged accordingly....n indeed time Will come when God will give His judgement
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😂😂😂😂😂😂😬💔💔💔💔hawa wanaume wa dimples....aty dark tall and handsome 😂😂😂😂🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Signs of end time waaaaaaaa .....we should fear sin ... this is among the 7 things that God hates😌😌😌😌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I respect your decision to be together we can't all be the same if you are truly ok then kudos to you and I wish you well
q4sWUJxjc4g,BS. Am sure hes still cheating in the two poor women 😡
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham comes off as such a very selfish man. 😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,No to judge but Maureen sounds very inconsistent
q4sWUJxjc4g,No to judge but Maureen sounds very inconsistent
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Greetings from Deutschland
Thanks guys for sharing this wonderful Story...We love you so much.. Thanks  dear lyn  for the show."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Seems nice. Let them enjoy their union.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati anawasaidia....😅😅😅
Sad though😥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""I'm the wife to Abraham"" this statement already says ""one"" meaning they all want it to be the one and only. It's possible to find a way to cope and accept such a situation BUT everyone is hurting and covering it up in some way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you did this for your selfish interest. You told Sarah you wouldn't leave Maureen 's child without a father figure and was ready to move out to go to Maureen. However, you were ready to leave Sarah and her child to go live with Maureen.  Abraham is happy because he has fulfilled his selfish desire. Maureen keep the respect that you have for Sarah. Both of you keep about his satisfaction and happiness.  What about yourselves?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lyn your interviewing skills are on another level. Kudos bwana ! As an aspiring behavioral therapist, Cera’s body language speaks of suppressed internal pain. Maybe she is scared of losing the marriage and what society will say.  If she is happy to get involved, I suggest that Lyn makes a future follow up with her alone.  She might benefit from psychological therapy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I want to know is now he leaves these two women and goes ‘to work overnight’. Are they worried he is busy making a new baby/wife ?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen looks older than both cera n  brahim .......hakuna marriage ya third party
q4sWUJxjc4g,Unmarried women are quick to judge this beautiful family. If this works for them I could not be happier for them. What is the other option being a single parent? And some of you who are in denial your husbands have wives and kids out there you will meet when they dies. Thank you for sharing your life story and inspiring some of us to look for as many wives as we can support.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissism
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@reenrono7721 You are probably unmarried and over 35, don’t look half as good as you did 10 years ago."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@carolinetwangechi2402 I was just being supportive but she is calling me names. If it works for them..sawa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah's facial expressions shows that she is not fully healed. May God continue giving her grace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support polygamy period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Seeing a financially independent woman subjecting herself to such a life beats me I swear... 

Sodenote: the wives look alike, he has a type."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Watching this one month later and I hope serah got help. There have been times in my life when I thought I was okay with some things but I wasn't. I needed help. I hope my namesake gets help.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki serah is not happy at all woii😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Christians do not have more than one wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,why would these ladies agree to this kind of marriage?? it's not fair to the main wife....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They say they are friends🤪.Only time will tell . History has shown that it doesn’t last long , so spare us and don’t peddle that lie ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hhmm... It's  a tough cal. I'm  focusing on the body language Here! I'm  no  body language expert, however,  the little I know,/ understand, he seems more in love with the  second wife.. Sarah, in due course,  I'm  sure you will have more  strength. Otherwise,  Sarah my thoughts are with you mama .Hhhmm... Then this  Maureen?????!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't think it's as bad as some of us think.
1.How do Muslims deal with polygamous fans.
2.Remember there are more women in kenya than men. So there is bound to be ladies who will not get a male companion if we were all to be paired up 1 man 1 woman.
Let's be honest  it's better to be a 2nd wife than a side chick. Even for a wife, it's better to have your husband in a particular home than have him hoping all over the country,  especially in the night when he has to criss cross the city trying to get home before morning."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really feel for sarah honestly she isnt happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish Cera could learn early enough to save her happiness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The whole thing is a mess.  No body wins.  The women are both broken and he is taking advantage of their brokeness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looks like there is some pain hidden in Sarah's heart anyway time will tell 
But Sarah you deserve better than this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Corozon and Maureen and Frankie awww♥️ can't wait
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ikr🤣🤣🤣with their 2 kids each
q4sWUJxjc4g,This has proved to me that there is nothing you can do to keep a man. Abraham keeps saying how good serah is but he still got another woman. This guy is a real narcissist.  The things women go through aki in this marriages.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sorry serah......she even took her no.moreen chunga sana machozi ya a prayerful woman,serah is soo saad aki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like how Abraham is justifying his greed while claiming to be a Christian.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen  saying that  no any discussions  about  each other is a lie, coz wen ur 2 in the bed what do you  discuss, what will you tell ur daughter  about  moral, infidelity, cheating  and marriage when she's fully grown  for that, snatching  someone's husband  was good that's  why you're  a second  wife, do you  go to church, wen the pastor  anakemea adultery  what do you  do"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Trauma Traumatic Traumatized Traumatizing 💔 😢 😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The three of them have figured out how to live together. Relationships are not easy by a long short, I wish them all the best"
q4sWUJxjc4g,ceerah is still in pains
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Jesus,yaani moreen husikiangi umekosea ,where is ur conscience,weweee ilikufa ok"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God united one man with one woman(not women) . The union is not biblical. Traditionally accepted but not a bed of roses . The honeymoon will soon be over. Pole cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is total madness.
Cera wake up"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If you love the first wife you wouldn't get another. The second wife is causing problems for herself and generation.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man looks cute and still young,,,marrieng two wife's almost same age and almost same number of children my friend it's a biiiiig job I pray fo you to remain with only them and be faithful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Married as a second,,but kuishi nyumba moja is a never,,,we are in the same compound at home but I leave in Nairobi coz of work nampenda I respect her alot ,,,,tunaheshimiana coz she's ten years older than me so heshimalazima,,lakini kuzoeana sijui kuishi nyumba moja is a never on me,,,we talk we do things together lakini mzoeano noooooo,,,and bytheway she's a Kikuyu and she did a wedding,,,and am a maasai I also did a wedding,,,our lovely man is now very settle with two of us I can guarantee he can't cheat out there,,,,,we are God fearing people and we all respect each other,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man loves Maureen more. He wouldn't have cared if he lost Sera. With time her feelings will be numb because when love isn't appreciated it runs out. Hopefully she'll be financially stable by then.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Gods grace weeeeuh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The only thing I can learn from the Story is to fear The 'Moreens', Serah is not fine. We can see it. She is just tolerant"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a greedy man 👨 you commit bigamist you want too much he can never love both of you the same way that’s a lie he will love one more than the other women you don’t know what you want
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves Maureen most
q4sWUJxjc4g,My only question na huwa mnaenda church gani kweliii waaaaaaah?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeeeeh the audacity
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waohoo  so amazing.may God bless the  family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The first wife is going through hell and trying so hard to hide as for you Moureen, you are and forever will be a home wrecker for Abraham you have no respect for women at all... Even the bible has put it clear one woman one man or better stay single....Moureen and Abraham wait for God to deal with you too mercilessly"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hypocrisy of the highest order, you realize he is a married man and the wife just had a baby and you continue seeing the man with the nonsense of go home go home🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hope one day, Maureen will repent and leave somebody’s husband. It will not be well with her till she corrects the error."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"MAUREEN IS A STRANGER,PAINKILLER,CARETAKER...AND WASTING TIME IN LIFE"

q4sWUJxjc4g,MAUREEN ANAKAA SHUSH ...TU MIAKA TUMEENDA
q4sWUJxjc4g,SECOND WIFE IS JUST WASTING TIME AND IS PAINKILLER
q4sWUJxjc4g,THE SECOND WIFE IS NOT IN PLAN OF GOD AND GOD WILL BREAK IT...MWK
q4sWUJxjc4g,These women!!!!!!!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you got a third one, would you still take? Would they still accept?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A foundation built on someone's tears and pain will never be right, how do you even guide your kids in future when you failed?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Marriage is monogamous, the moment the third party came in it was over, this guy had a whole affair out of marriage and getting married to the side piece is just to conceal his mistakes."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the grace of God,this home wrecker will soon face her karma ,nkt!!ugly woman.... May God help Cerah 🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is so pure🥺🥺🥺,this other woman is a destroyer!!plus the guy?? he's just confused as his small genitals nkt🙄🙄 I'm so pissed because clearly Cerah deserves the best ..huyu baby mama ata majibu zake ain't genuine 🙄mara ntv alisema hivi...aaah wananiplooofok why???"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Maureen's story leaves a lot of loopholes. Cerah is a great-hearted and strong woman who has accepted the ills of her husband's infidelity with much constructive forgiveness. God bless you Cerah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is humble I’m sure she had no option, she has some grief chocks her when she is about to speak, but all the same, this 2nd one she is humble too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,i thought the man was elderly. This's just a selfish man and they should be ready for another & other women to come.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a no no.
Cera us just playing low.
She would have just left the guy for that lady ju ata such relationships never last."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy wouldn't work for me but they really seem to work. I actually admired their chemistry
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfishness at its best
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Lucy, thanks that's the encouragement we need to give them and any other families that find themselves in such a setup."
q4sWUJxjc4g,That maln is happy wueeeeh 😍😍 currently in the same situation but not married I think I can try kama itakua hivi😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeuwe..Hii text imeninice😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man is to blame..he knew he has a wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,He knew what he wanted..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel disappointed..Sarah pack you're bag's and leave is never too late.. GOD will make it up to u
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is the one he choosed after all u been thru...pray for GOD'S INTERVENTION...this sickening..he will definitely bring 3rd wife..
q4sWUJxjc4g,and the most annoying this is dude thinks he is all that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If it was  a woman who did the same thing that Abraham did it could have been a different story , the wouldn't think twice to send her away"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are trying to normalize a foundation started on lies and lies, he did not even consult or discuss with the first wife whether to bring another one, what a useless dude"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If cards were reversed.... would either of you accept the situation that the first wife is accepting?????
Thats how to know how she truly feels..... she is just a super nice person and that kind gets stepped on too often too much."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Serah.Beautiful and calm.This man took advantage of her.And it won't stop there.Wait for a third co-wife.Serah deserves much more better.
q4sWUJxjc4g,And now he’s using her and his marriage arrangements to get a YouTube channel to get money. Sad really
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't believe that a man should have more than one wife even though this situation seems to work for this family. They stress on truth, respect, honestly  and love and it's good for them. I must say that the real hero of this story is Serah she is a wise woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel to cry boz of Sarah,if I can woke up en found me as a man,i can marry Cerah,coz 1000she is 1,God fight 4cerah,never mighty let him go becoz of this silly girl"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The spirit of polygamy fire fire fire .... In the name ofJesus
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is disgusting
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣 sina ngufu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can't imagine myself in the shoe of serah
This so 💔💔💔💔
Am trying to imagine ""my husband"" bringing another woman in my house as a second wife!???
With my heart can't tolerate infidelity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good job dada Lynn be blessed too with all yr colleagues
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish you long life peace and happyness in yr marriage blessed
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera….look at your self in the mirror,if you can only see what we see in you,you will know you deserve better."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki wewe Lynn wee umenibamba mbaya kuulizia venye walifika kwa hao na vile aliamusha mrembo na enjoy show all the way from Saudi bt l'm a Kenyan Citizen
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so sad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No way...sera,'s heart am sure is breading ni vile she is not saying da truth..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you're contradicting yourself. 
Mara you didn't know he was married, then you had Cera's number all along. This Father Abraham is selfish and narcissistic. It's all about him. My marriage was ruined by 2nd wife after I got tired and left, she too run the heels to the mountains. Right now the guy is miserable. Fr. Abraham women has turned kings to beggers ok, don't forget to update us about your empire 5 yrs down the lane."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women are so abused this is ridiculous this guy is a player and he's playing them both he already has several small houses besides these women smfh
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's how Lynn asks questions for me😂😂😂 she will grill you to the end bruh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nkt eti second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not happy and that marriage has no God in it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something is not right......
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know Cerah has some prayers that she can only mutter May God answer Her
q4sWUJxjc4g,They should be another man in this relationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Requirements to be a third wife be light skinned and wear heels.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man has gayish treats the way is talking facial expressions and hand gestures 🤔 what an unfortunate situation for the first wife I don't care how they are trying to make it sound good it's all fake.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this man is manipulative 
telling your wife that you are not leaving your child when you are caught cheating?..i feel for Serah..he sound like a narcissist..(my opinion)..thank you Lynn for asking the right questions."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cheater😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn hard on the questions but still engaging😂smart
nakupenda Lynn na umeiva siiet"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is adultery...why is Maureen not remorseful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Baba Abraham pliz add number three.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am very impressed at the friendship between the two wives. That's huge!! Wow!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah needs to trend very carefully and protect her interest
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The caption of the video speaks alot. I'm sure it wasn't planned, just coincidental"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is a peaceful woman God bless your heart,am in a situation like that , life do humble us at times.never say never."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just go get your own husband, before God you are not a wife you must accept that"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can see fake smiles here
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen ulitoa nguvu wapi?
q4sWUJxjc4g,What rubbish is this? You need Jesus young boy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Stupid man. The laughing here is just wrong. Why do all this young man. You went out of the marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi siwesmake! Vayolence pap! Weueh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,A good lie
q4sWUJxjc4g,He knew he had Sera wrapped arround hs finger and threatened Maureen that he would keep his child. Maureen had no business dating a married man. This man has narsistic tendancies and very controlling. I pray Serah get to heal and know herself as well as see the manupilation that has happened here. Couples argue but that is no escuse to bring in another woman into your life and home....very heatbreaking...her smile and demeanor tells it all. She has held in so uch just to keep her home together but this man doesn not deserve her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah was a full package and still you got another woman who does that you living in denial
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife looks humble and looks as she's passing through something
q4sWUJxjc4g,If I was Serah I would get out of this marriage or Moreen should never involved with this man after she get to know that the man was married. Is this man a using these women?
q4sWUJxjc4g,The MOST AND HIGHLY FAVOURED MAN AND HIS BELOVED WIVES. PURE LOVE ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is so heartbteaking
😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is in pain for sure..sijui ni watoto walimuweka ama ni kusema mimi sitoki kwangu... woiii aki I am a different breed. Niliacha mansion I sweated for 3yrs juu ya hii upus. Ladies and girls pls jipendeni to accommodate manipulation all sorts... life has no rehearsal aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,So he cheated and Cerah forgave them? That is the sad part
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact is no matter how much you try to prove a wrong to be right it will never be,a sin is a sin.Serah may seem or appear to be ok but it will never be ok.my advice to those are in Moureens position just leave before u go too far.Respect marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera hana furaha unasikia akipumua,she is still burning inside,wanaume Mungu anawaona"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera alikubali kwa kuogopa kumpoteza mwanaume kwakuwa yeye ndio kapenda,mwanaume mapenzi yako kwa Moreen,ila sara anamtumia kwa kuwa walianza wote.But hana mapenzi.Moreen ujapendwa na Sera amekubali kwakuwa hakuna namna,wake up katafute mume wako"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah she is not happy,aliamua kukubali yaishe deepdown anajihisi hakukamilika kwahiyo amekubali ili jamaa anachokikosa akipate."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder why so many ladies are telling cera to leave the marriage ! Our cucu walikuwa wanaolewa even 4 wives and they lived  well. Where is the problem today? Its good to be open rather than having multiple  women out there as side chicks. Bravo Abraham.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At least people in polygamous relationships are honest with each other,because majority of people in  monogamy relationships live double lives, if these 3 say they are happy, then they are.. no need to project your preferred lifestyle on them, research about the African Hebrew Israelites in denoma Israel they marry as many as 4 and it works for them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't get enough of this story it's my 5th time to watch ..team LN nipeeni trophy 🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This s**t happened to smn I know, and thirty years later the person talks abt how sad she was and how she had to swallow the pain through the years and just stayed for reasons 'beyond love'....all the while being subjected to cruelty and even physical abuse to control her... I personally feel this is Cerah's story in the making, but we wish her well as she tries hard to convince the whole world and herself that she is ok and happy, am sure she has repeated this to herself long enough to finally accept it as the truth.
As per the comments here, the dude talks highly of Maureen and when he keeps saying that he 'looks beyond love' in regards to Cerah he says it all..
Few years later, my person's hubby added wives 3 and 4, and these are the ones we know of...Ladies, be braced for this eventuality. 
We wish you well."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can I have two husband's 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree with my name sake,I was raised by a single mother,I wish she allowed me to know my father, there is that part in me that has a void a missing dad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is the guy a luo or Kikuyu?
q4sWUJxjc4g,A true father Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sorry  for Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤔🤔🤔😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,As much as they are ok with polygamus now the question comes is what do they think of the kind of role model they are giving to their kids. For a daughter it will be ok to marry two men and for son vice verca.  Mmmm just wondering what advice would they give?
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy is cunning she played Cera please beautiful take heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham had many sons ,had many sons so father Abraham!!! A song that just came on my mind that  we used to sing back in the days."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Loving at 1am😂😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ur funny kkk
q4sWUJxjc4g,My grandfather died early because of this nonsense 🤣.... He married 7 wives .... Wakabaki wakimaliziana watoto.... Uchawi to-date
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the issue to me is marrying someone, telling her that ""it will only be me and you. no one else (if that was not the case, why the guilt mentioned at 24:40?), then bringing another woman later. then the agreement. I think Sarah is just trying to cope. she was not prepared for what she is facing. If the 2 women are honest, they should allow their husband to add more wives if he wishes."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"High level of infidelity covering it up with love ..""he has to go behold love to check the value""..cerah wake up"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"According to me,Abraham LOVES Moreen but LIKES Cera,he wouldn't mind loosing Cera as long as she left the kids with Moreen on the other hand he would fight to keep Moryn,if he's given a chance to choose one that will definitely be Moryn.Cera loves Abraham and to continue owning him she had no option but to accept Moryn,she invited her in her house because she was afraid she will completely lose Abraham to Moryn.Moryn isn't bad though she tried to stay away but love between them won, as long as she respects Cera and all are happy and comfortable its OK.......my opinion✌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You narrate it so well and comfortably until it finds ya💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham's Empire
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen please find your own husband bec Abraham belongs to Serah please do yourself a favor and love yourself just go, time will tell"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thez nothing to be happy in a polygamous family,its just a matter of time"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My goodness I think this cerah is my sister in doom.....men will embarrass you walai..story for another day
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wish you all the best... The maturity in both ladies is adorable coz it's not easy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Neither monogamy or polygyny is easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,What maturity nonsense 😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu jamaa akihanya sasa ndio ataona moto from both🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,PEOPLE MIGHT JUDGE BUT FAMILY ACCEPTANCE IS HUGE HEALING THEY CAN DO BETTER..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just out of curiosity.. what will make Abraham not do the same with another woman? 2face and Annie's story gives me chills!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Feeling like asking of the same!
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn Ngugi,
Please give us Cera's number. Together as women we are ready to contribute finances to get her out of that house with that abusive, selfish, narcissistic man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera has such a sad demeanor about her, at some point i thought she was going to break down on the video .Is she really ok?@Lynn, please please refer her professional counselling support, just incase she needs it. When she talks she looks at the guy as if seeking approval .There also seems to be some power struggle and she feels inferior, could be wrong though. However, she needs to get psychosocial support and i hope she  never lose herself as a woman in all this .She is such a beautiful soul and i wish her Gods strength and Love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It can't work for long.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you so beautiful inside and out. May Jehovah bless you add you more grace. Maureen keep respecting Sera and never ever point a finger to her, and will be blessed , it takes God grace for you to be together, hakuna ubaya continue living together and bring up a wounderful home. 🙌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't trust this guy if he becomes more successful financially he will marry 10 more wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,CERAH🤲😫♥️🥺ALL WILL BE WELL😩♥️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sooo, the husband  saw  maid/househelp/maid coz she cleaned your house? N did your laundry???!  Very suspect.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Both Maureen n Abraham have bn lying abt how the fell in love with each other. I can feel their guilt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am just passing by a month later to say, Lynn, you are the oprah of our time, your interview skills are top notch. May God keep moulding and lifting you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki Mimi siwezi, there is nothing to learn here,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was thinking the same thing!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@susangakeni4847 bye
q4sWUJxjc4g,Majority of African men have no self control cos society has overpampered them. Men shld bare in mind that it is some of us women that allow u guys to do these things to us else I don't know or see how n where u wld practice this stupid polygamy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is too young for this, cos I forsee him getting another fair younger lady in the near future since he admitted light skinned ladies r his problem. Besides Serah had no choice but stay for the sake of kids. So unfortunate. We shldnt glorify this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham started a channel for his children to emulate....did I hear well? Emulate polygamy???
q4sWUJxjc4g,The gentleman is lying mbu buy her coffee just for just...I was relating with her(2nd wife) on work issues late...riyalllleee!!! Men! Men!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is God doing and it will prosper
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen u went ahead and sired a child with a married man knowingly. You are a home wrecker however good u pretend to be. Be ready to face God's wrath. And you Abraham, u betrayed your wife, a wife u started from the scratch with"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is an urgent need here...of some serious counselling. This is a ticking time bomb!!
Edit: Thanks Lynn. Your clarity and thought process are impeccable."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True its a ticking bomb. there must be some temporary glue holding this unusual union together and i guess its money, probably Cerah doesnt have enough and vulnerable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Sarah. She is a strong woman.Her hubby is insensitive.How dare he say that he did not want to lose the then side chick
q4sWUJxjc4g,@lena Kindly try to be positive and supportive than alarming
q4sWUJxjc4g,what kind of timebomb? We have seen polygamous marriages that are way better than monogamous.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that Serah asked of Maureen and he froze shows that was a wrong move. That guy is manipulative and will end up marrying 5 to 7 business partners... The first wife was betrayed
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know what to say but I don't like Abraham and moreen
q4sWUJxjc4g,bambi Maureen any day any time karma will come for you.  safe stay in hell
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some man never love the first wife!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was convincing myself to be cera but....I am stuck somewhere in the middle
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man will go up to 4 😂😂. He is a real man. I support him as long he can take care of all of them physically and financially
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn hii upuzi ndio hatutaki Kenya..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kenya will soon become the capital city of Africa . This kind of life in the 21st century? Ha!
q4sWUJxjc4g,They two beautiful ladies are beautiful and intelligent…but have low self esteem….hurtful!
q4sWUJxjc4g,You’re greedy.. and they’re stupid!and God is watching you all stewwwww!!! Nonsense!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't understand why people are against Maureen,Sh'z cool, family is cool, cerah made peace with herself way before she met her. The beauty about the union is that they came to an agreement. Long live the Abraham's. Many people are out there hiding, this one came out so well. Congratulations fam. Wishing you lotsa blessings 💞💞"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah but she didn't want to
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what is marriage if after 8 years some other woman will show up as a wife to your husband. This is so painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,All said and done a big no. Why did God not create for Adam two wives?
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think this Abraham and Maureen look down upon sera....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Total BS to be honest,, the first woman deserves better and should have known her worth and walked away. How sure are both women that he is not seeing other women anyway?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God forbid! Everything is wrong with this family setup.. To each their own, lakni hii..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham n moureen ,God is watching you.and for sure you will pay for Ur adultery  ,am not judging tho.sera Ur faithfulness will never go in vain."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is not easy tasks I have ever experienced that I was in Cera position  but in such situations God will give you more strength and power to manage everything in claim ways more especially when kids are involved.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera ran away from this marriage you deserve better
q4sWUJxjc4g,...ati the husband ana waambia 'keep strong's..ata ye anajua this women need strength 😂😂wueh😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen anakaa wa ma-moods. Wanawake wawili under the same roof? I doubt, wacha mkae for at least two and a half years that's when you will know the true colors of each of you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can tell Abraham is in love with maureen cera may God give you peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah he likes mentioning Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will get another wife for sure... that's pure LUST not LOVE!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is that ONE question whose answer everyone wants to know but no one wants to ask ^-^
q4sWUJxjc4g,What's that
q4sWUJxjc4g,hehe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's sad to watch, they took advantage of Cerah I am sure with time she will process and decide on what she wants"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera looks  very humble  lady God  be with u
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can Abraham separate these two ladies for God's sake...kila mtu aishi kwake. I really pity cerah...and how on earth is maureen soo comfortable at someone else's home?anyway...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a video stumbled upon! Great interviewer there I must not forget. This two, the side woman but particularly the young man are BAD EXAMPLES  of comittment and discipline in love/marriage; the entanglement is JUST NOT SWEET TO HEAR...especially seeing/hearing his first wife! Three CANNOT be one....ONLY TWO; they are on a time bomb, sorry to say! May this bomb blow up slowly to reset brains here! May this three find Jesus Christ indeed!! Sad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No man on earth can love 2 women ,period!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,i hope cerah gets courage to walk out someday....she aint happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Christ's sake!! I do understand most african countries polygamy is acceptable but again In this decade of 21st century and the living costs/crisis which are unbearable, I basically don't think this situation of these 3 musketeers should be entertained. The person running this interview should be there convincing Lady Maureen ( the marriage wrecker to find a solution elsewhere ASAP!!!). NOTHING TO DISCUSS OVER AND OVER HERE. What on earth is this ? Bigamy, cheating, stupidity ......? And this man Abraham sits back comfortably laughing there without using his other 4 senses like "" we are Okay, I love them both bloody shenanigans!! This is a way much sensitive life the 3 of these are living, come one particular dawn,  one of this individuals will perish everyone else in ashes for the accumulated pain lived with. Lady Maureen, think  reeaaally hard for your consequence. You are an intelligent home wrecker. Sarah, just bare in mind Lady Maureen is only buying time so stop pouring your good heart to evil 😈. She will turn against you. Na ndio hivo nimeenda!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is very possible that a man can love his wives equally just like women love their children. I feel Abraham is that kind
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn? No comment on this one...speechless!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A match made in Heaven indeed! I just love this trio! Many factors considered by me, a psychologist, a woman of God, and a minister in the field of love. I pray for the best for them. Love wins always! Oh and by the way, this Abraham carries a lot of wisdom and and he's so smart! Cera, I love your heart, Maureen, I love your heart too ... Live long all!!! Don't bother to explain anything to anyone, ONLY deeply spirited people can understand your set up! Blessings galore!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Are the two women sleeping together?just wondering🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First of all YOU WOULD NOT BETRAY A PERSON YOU CHERRIES once betrayal has set in please don't mention LOVE anymore 💕. Love is SINCERE and lying to Cera just to be with another woman, that it is late and you can't make it home leaving her in distress shows how you do not care about Her feelings. I hope the Lord COMFORT  and GUIDE Her. 
I love the interviewer so much she is so intelligent and Smart.  She didn't miss out on any thing she is supposed to ask the man and the Enemy who has come to steal and to destroy irrespective of her WELL PLANNED  lies."

q4sWUJxjc4g,He says everything except a husband.  Both women said they were his wife.  He never said he was their husband.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissist at his best😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You cry out, “Why doesn’t the Lord accept my worship?” I’ll tell you why! Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young. But you have been unfaithful to her, though she remained your faithful partner, the wife of your marriage vows. Didn’t the Lord make you one with your wife? In body and spirit you are his. And what does he want? Godly children from your union. So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth.
Malachi 2:14‭-‬15 NLT"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham answered well, no man can serve  2 masters.  The only good thing is that Maureen didn't know from the beginning."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To have a 2nd wife there'll always be lies.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They, Abraham and  Maureen wronged Sarah and she didn't have anything to do about it.  He would not have told her had she not find out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is not genuine...ooops🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
q4sWUJxjc4g,The way he is so comfortable narrating this shows he wouldn't mind picking a third wife 😢... what's this?🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,He definitely will get athird one
q4sWUJxjc4g,God is clear
q4sWUJxjc4g,Promoting poligamy is antichrist
q4sWUJxjc4g,God is the author of marriage and he is clear about his way
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pretence
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ujinga gani hii? This can NEVER be God's will,smh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The insanity of this is they're all acting like they're leading a revolution of some sort and being courageous...all along raising kids in massive confusion and lies. Damn.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor kids born out of this mess!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So let me get this right, what began as cheating is being paraded as a healthy relationship? I would like to be critical and condemn them but it is not my place. I appreciate this over him raising Maureen and her kids in secret. I appreciate Lynn as an interviewer, you have more patience and grace than I, I can not imagine anyone in my family or me going through this and hiding behind Christianity."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please don't follow this man's way of life. There are always hidden hatred among siblings and co- wives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's just witchcraft
q4sWUJxjc4g,"all i see in this video is maturity, thank u serah for having this beautiful heart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well ts just but a tragedy I presume.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its all written on the wall! The man ako kwa ka stage flani (not mature, utoto, umalaya ya kushika tupesa) cerah, a loyal true, mature, kind but hurt woman who needs time to heal n move on. Maureen, this tumalaya unremorseful women who chase men wth ""kakitu""  irregardless of their marital status. money is life to them! Pretence is her portion!.  Time will tell!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is nothing but an opportunist an narcissist!!!! Smh.
Women pls we should know our value!!! 
If you have male children pls teach them how to respect and love the other sex, don't make them feel like the male gender is superior but teach them that all genders matters.
This is a man with a disgusting ego, maybe because of the way he was raised!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really dont think serah is happy at all,she love her man and bn with him even after he married another woman was a choice of love.she look like a good girl"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you are asking the right questions. I can see the pain Cera is going through, this Abraham guy has managed to manipulate these women. I hope they wake up soonest. Watching how this guy is narrating the story makes me sick, he is getting a kick out of all this🙄🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, please interview this threesome five years following this interview. We want to know where this goes.🤷🏽‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,SICK!! 400 YEARS OF SUFFERING AND SLAVERY [...] AND WE STILL SINNING AGAINST THE LORD GOD...BLACK PEOPLE COME BACK TO JESUS...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is so gentle n calm. A phlegmatic . People tend to take advantage of such.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am here to see the judges who think kuna dhambi na kadhambi.....others think Cerah is unhappy🤣🤣 weeeh everybody will be judged personally not as a couple......That is if the Bible    is real....😉😉
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sorry for those women who have to deal with this situation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very toturing for these women to share man. They are helpless
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree, both have serious esteem issues"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This men think hi is God
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sorry for these women, this man is using them sexually. 😢sad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is what low self- value looks like, even a young child can tell that the first wife is just going along with the circus just to please the clown 🤡, But for how long ? No matter how much this first wife pretends she is okay with this low level cheater and his new trophy she is not happy . 
Sadly she has convinced herself that she is fine with it. Only time and divine intervention will help her. Trying to turn betrayal into something positive , it never works ,especially in situations like this. I hope she wakes up soon and leaves that egotistical narcissistic liar🤥 .
This ain’t no fairytale but some sick nightmare especially for Sara."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second woman should go
q4sWUJxjc4g,This men is using those women
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah take it easy mama,your facial expressions tells all.

Abraham you are not loyal.
Maureen you are home breaker may God forgive you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very soon number three
q4sWUJxjc4g,This comment section is interesting. Y’all mad because she chose a man with money? And went with what he wanted? This clearly shows that women and men nature are DIVINELY different . I do agree that the way he went about it was weak. Everything is still a choice .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As an African American lady, polygamy is NOT my culture.   I never grew up with it because it did not exist in My Family.   I never saw people involved in it thus, I can NOT & do NOT understand How a Woman would be truly Happy in such an arrangement. 
    I would Never get involved in polygamy & it is illegal in America, which is GREAT!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Minute 20.41 ""Her level of calmness ......"" That calmness needs to go. All you three lost souls should read the Bible to find your worth in God's eyes and claim it.  Marriage is God's gift for one man and one woman. God bless you all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just as in the case of R Kelly where two women were defending him and concealing their pain then one returned many months later to say she was completely lost at the time, I expect to see one of these women return to confess that she was completely lost in this episode."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can’t watch this to the end. Rivals are rivals. Even God couldn’t accept it. Wherever there is polygamy there is problem even in the Bible.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It’s always a contradiction for society. You blame men for single children without dads then blame men for polygamy. You need to choose one position, as you can’t have it both ways."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It felt so bad when Serah said she wanted to meet Moureen coz the husband had really said good things/praises about her🤔🤔🤔🤔Serah my dia may favour n Gods grace locate you always.Bitterness n betrayal is all over you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is beautiful but looks sad, the man keeps interrupting her when she is sharing her points. Like she shouldn't talk."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a liar... 😀
q4sWUJxjc4g,The hypocrisy here screams so loud. Most of the ladies would gladly take their position with any wealthy man. Poverty is the enemy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ironically they are called Sarah and Abraham. Maureen should have been called Hagar. Lolzzz.  Just like Sarah in the bible she's gonna be fed up. Hagar go read your bible !
q4sWUJxjc4g,No amount of excuse /reasoning in the name of Love can make a Polygamy right..Cera God keep you strong ....

q4sWUJxjc4g,Karibu Lynn akae vibaya kwa hii interview.. ama Mimi ndio nimeona hii pekee yangu wadau 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dealing with offenses is an art. Serah you are a master piece. I hope that lady had not brought hell in your home. That friendship is fake no heaven has made it. Serah do not have choice but is being bullied by let alone an immature and insensitive husband. Time will offer a solution. Watching from Zim 🇿🇼
q4sWUJxjc4g,I also think the friendship is fake 🤥
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel that Sarah has not given the chance to digest the situation. Sarah is getting on with what the husband want in fear of loosing him. It looks like Sarah envy the second wife in a good way but no woman will accept second wife whole heartedly. These two produced a baby behind Sarah’s back. The second woman was calculative she knew what she wanted from get go pretending as if she cares about Sarah’s well-being she shouldn’t have gotten pregnant before meeting Sarah to discuss the new future. With a baby she had already pushed her way in and Sarah didn’t have choice but to accept the situation. This man is acting as if all is well l don’t think it is these woman don’t look happy rather artificial,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sugarcoating it looks.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen should wake up and find her own man
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a confused man. Has no clue what love is.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Dear ladies,may we never get to this level of disrespect in Jesus name"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So even being good to a man doesn't guarantee a faithful husband.this is insane i pity Sarah but i know sarah has a  favor from God.the man and the intruder are living in sin because it's against God's law.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is very beautiful and looks young,she is still hurting and she has not healed and all I can say mourine is a home wrecker."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am happy for them and wish them all the luck i will not judge  them , they are content with Abraham who are we to judge? love wins at the end. 
So continue enjoying life and ignore  the haters ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Plz ppl lets support Cerah's business
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow where do l start. There are so real and not under pressure. I know we have different opinions but who am l to throw a stone!?! Polygamy was there with our forefathers traditionally. Also in the bible there is Abraham. The main thing is the people involved!, are they comfortable in the arrangement? To the men out there many have side chicks and live a lie. How does it sit in your conscience? I am not accusing anyone but highlighting a norm. Cheating is painful. Being open is good and if the concerned people accept the arrangement 🤷🏽‍♀️🤔. Please l beg don’t respond insulting me. I am sharing my opinion and everyone is entitled to their opinion. Asante sana🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well said my dear,  a lot of people pointing fingers at them do worse things, hiding theirs , who is righteous ?? Let him/ her say?? We like judging people too much ,leave God to be the judge ,He sees what's inside the heart of man . The most important thing is he's a responsible man and takes care of his family, he's not asking anyone to feed his family ,leave them alone weather they're faking it or not."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is very innocent to be honest... but why she welcomed Moreen in her own home it's because she made a mistake when first she didn't build her relationship on a right foundation when she stepped in marriage... Married for 8yrs is not a joke cause you have invested much in each other.🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is beautiful!!! Keep it up keep it real!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I personally find this situation disgusting. It really upsets my stomach. You can see that the first wife is not happy.

Edit: Cerah is beautiful but she lacks self esteem. She thinks she can't find better. Personally, I would have left. The husband and the second wife are disgusting and purely deserve each other. Nonsense to put God into this mess.
They ( husband and 2nd wife) really thought that people will find this mess okay. This is degeneracy ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@ Mar Best comment ever. I personally don't feel sorry for her. These are the choices she has made .She is settling and like Sarah in the bible she gonna find out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am curious do they sleep in the same bed au wakona different bedrooms?
q4sWUJxjc4g,He looks like someone who will go on to marry a third wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ngathooooo he even said he spends more time on dates with Maureen cause they work together.Serah is furniture please free yourself
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a narcissistic 🐖 and he has gay vibes

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen used pregnancy to hook Abraham.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is skilled in manipulation techniques also, he capitalized on the fact that Cerah is a kind and soft hearted woman who will never allow a situation to run out of hand...in order words she's is a peace maker! But she is a broken person and she's helplesss, the Maurene of a woman is heartless and dangerous!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I will not judge but this is a cheating gone right the man literally cheated and the wife was so in love she accommodated the whole situation 😭 I hope she is really happy and not doing this for media pressure.All i can say please empower your daughters so they can know when to say NO to this kind of disrespect and really know their worth.......no wonder he is called father  Abraham unapologetically...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor Maureen, she's set up for cyber bullying. Otherwise I respect this family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First wife is younger than the second wife😳😳,Eiish Father Abraham had many wives*2
Ooh Father Abraham..........."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife is pretending to be fine with everything! In my opinion she should leave before she wasted anymore of her God given time! She’ll regret if she stays!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is nonsense! The only person benefiting from this arrangement is the man.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maybe a question to the two ladies is if they want the same experience to happen to their children.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen will you be happy and accommodative if Abraham decides to marry a third wife?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham kindly mind what you say, you easily hurt Cerah but protect Maureen with your words."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel so sad for the first wife. You know its not easy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen I sense hypocrisy whenever you laugh.I pray God gives u enough wisdom to understand what Serah is going through and one day one time u give her space she may enjoy her marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mwangi you are cheating...
Beyond love ????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,this is just selfishness of Abraham and Moreen period. May God continue blessing u Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,MAUREEN The Home Wrecker!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you are one a million,may God continue blessing you and may u never lack peace and happiness in your heart,much love from me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,shameless man
q4sWUJxjc4g,shameless man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mourren pls hio so bona yako toka ogopa MUNGU na uachie Sara boma yake
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn please follow up in 2030.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My question is how do you have the boundaries of ""don't touch my phone--I need my privacy,"" but not the boundaries of ""don't have a child outside of our marriage?""!! This is insane."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It absolutely doesn't make sense,  scued moral obligation and priorities"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Marriage is not for the faint hearted.sons of pharouh take advantage of there wives especially when they are pregnant.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Insane and very disrespectful 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not genuine at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii yote ni upuzi polygamy is the most useless thing I learned of while growing up. It may sound sweet now but polygamy is polygamy I have lived to hate it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hes basically saying in the beginning, ""I didn't have boundaries in my relationship which is why I would take my coworker out for coffee dates as 'courtesy'."" Beware wives of your husband's coworkers & how much quality time he's giving you. He even had a child with the women--had u not discovered it, he maybe wouldve continued to hide it! But their relationship is working, so to speak, so to each their own. At least he got married instead of having an extramarital long term affair."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huskii ako na another baby outside these two😂 huyu ni Malaya amekuja Tu kujitetea and has manipulated these women
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah 👍👍👍👍👍👍God bless you, for the good heart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is not easy 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 all the best guys
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've never seen this before ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,This mans arrogance  is so much  sara you a woman and half
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is so smart she brought her enemy closer and she is getting the same benefits as her co wife. And she is also making sure her kids get the same treatment and her co wife’s child. 
Cera’s mum must have advised her to take this route.
Maureen would get tired and leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's nothing smart here. Wasted time and enlarging your heart for nothing. She is settling!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My thoughts too,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you are always going to be blessed. I love how you promote your guests businesses. Your business would grow bigger and bigger. 
Cera is honestly a woman of God and she is using love to conquer the devils plan over her family. At the end she would definitely win. 
Cera is really smart she is playing the game as well but at the end Cera would overcome."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's T for Tough for many of us who can't even  comprehend  the all loving peaceful situation,  but all the best to them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah,I will keep you in my prayers,may God open your eyes, you deserve better!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah wake up and smell the coffee.  Leave these two.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's so complicated to understand this, Cerah still in pain it can't be healed in one year, this man is selfish at least you should not bring her in just sneak out there 😥😥 Am sorry for Cera.
Anyway guys support channel yangu jina
Hello Happy Tz
Thank you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Saddest story, very selfish egotistical heartless despicable man. Anyway, poor Serah. She is capable of getting a very good and faithful man. But we all make choices in life and we have to live with them. But that man, disgusting all adulterers have a place in hell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is heartless. And the other lady is heartless. I hope Sarah will find true love one day. I feel one day both of them will treat her mean.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn be asking the questions Cereh has deep down in her heart.  Thanx Lynn it will help with closure for Cereh.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know Cerah  as calm lady for many years a very good curtain designer
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is her job doing well or is it finances that are making her to stay? We can save her from these sad situation kama ni finances aki😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,I may not be an authority to comment on this but truth be told polygamy is never about love but selfishness. The Bible never talks about one's ribs but rib and talks of one man one wife. If the foundation of a marriage is hypocrisy and lies then it's sustainability is in doubt. It's never about material wealth but how rich you are in virtue.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank God cerah is more beautiful inside out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen captured and confused Abraham with love because she was desperate.she knew Abraham cared for cerah and for her to be in that marriage is to be nice to cerah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh Serah may God Bless your innocent soul.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man noo.. manipulative, selfish,cerah looks hurt and ofcos seeing your husband bring another woman to the home you built it's too painful to digest... Maureen nothing but home wrecker.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So much pain and betrayal....cheating to this extent is not something g to be proud of....I wish Serah will come to terms to with this,but I wish she could live in her own house away from this circus"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This can never be healthy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is wrong verrry Rong you are not Abraham neither are you the father of faith neither are you going to start a religion
q4sWUJxjc4g,Buda acha tu mke moja bana you have one sex organ and they are two ladies kwani huchoki bana spiritually it's wrong morally it's wrong it is RONGGGG.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My current situation.  I'm yet to inform my first wife.  I don't want to hide my children until they become adults.  Men, please come out in large numbers. Embrace polygamous relationships.  Stop hiding secret wives & children only for themselves force  for recognition after the demise of their secret fathers."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,When you lack confidence with yourself you allow other people to waste you because you think you can never get anything better. You settle for less. Very sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is not satisfied with this relationship facial expression it's saying it all may God see her through and to Maureen take care of Sarah's happiness it matters alot
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a narcissist! Notice how he does not let this women answer their own questions?
I hope this ladies go back and rewatch this taping. Maureen is so uncomfortable and doesn’t want to be there."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you are officially The undisputed Chairman of men's conference,
You are really trying.two lady in the same house is not a joke,If one is scary I can imagine two 😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not against polygamy but this story smells toxic to me.What did she mean i used to always send him home,so at wt point did she decide it was time to carry his baby.Second when Cerah confronted him abt having another woman all he did was go on defense and never acknolowdged her feeling.I hope Cerah your business blossoms so u could leave those two.Two manipulators deserve each other,right now they want to damage u and make u feel u owe them.By the way they never answered any qsns Lynn asked,all they did was gaslighting.Load of bs"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There’s this series on Showmax called uthando nes’thembu. This South African man has 4 wives and many children. After watching it,I am not shocked at this family. Abraham sounds so much like musa mseleku."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Heh kweli mambo ni mengi
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is Just so wrong and cringeworthy for heaven's sake Cerah deserves better. It's never that serious. And the guy is in his early 30's how many more will be in that union? Will Maureen be okay with the number 3 coz it is just a matter of time and karma awaits.
q4sWUJxjc4g,i can't imagine my husband having **x with another woman in a different room under my roof😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 cerah is a strong woman FR.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is my situation am only 24years old with 2kids and I tell you for sure it's never that easy I was married for 5years happily young marriage we were so happy and God bless us and we have to build,,Lyn let me tell you my husband leave me and got married to another woman now it's 1 year since he left and I tell you it's never easy aki..I understand the uchungu ya Sarah aki ni venye kweli hana othewise 💔💔💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah please wake up and see they have conspired to have a relationship that has no regard for your feelings at all. Clearly it is all about them. Leave this selfish man and this inconsiderate disrespectful woman in this mess. Any woman who will move into a house with a husband and wife is not worth 2 cents. Leave him so he can see how cheap she really is.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfishness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am sorry, but if I were the parents of Cerah I would be livid about Abraham taking another wife. I would let him know that with no uncertain terms and would not have a relationship with him one way or the other. As nice as he appears to be the message he is sending is selfish and self-centered. His wife should never have had to compete with another woman for any reason. As far as I am concerned he is a cheater and I would never support that. Cerah you are beautiful, move on to someone else who is waiting for 1 queen to enter his life. This is absurd!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,U can tell frm the gestures det he loves cerah more...1st wife alwys the 💪🏻
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't believe what Abraham did to Cera is fair. And he is not even apologetic. He is just justifying his selfishness. Abraham you have a high level of selfishness and lack self control. Cera is there for you, but you choose to betray her. This is betrayal of the highest order. You pursue another woman, and she was surely hurt. I really feel for her. And at your level of selfishness I don't believe you'll not want to bring in another woman. This should stop. Unless a wife asks you for a co-wife, to help her in case she's not able to be there for you all the time, then i can understand. But in this case you hid it from her and you're not even apologetic. I am so hurt on behalf of Cera. You really take her for granted. God will reward Cera, and you will reap the consequences of your actions"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes out to Cera. She stayed because for the love she had for her husband. Abraham clearly says that he wasn't ready to lose maureen but he doesn't say he wasn't ready to lose Cera.  One day Cera will have the strength to leave this selfish man and he will live to regret his actions.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Time will my dear yes, painful really"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a selfish man, anyway what goes around comes around. It's a love triangle 📐 trap, very painful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Try to be positive Caro, let’s pray for them than cast as passion"
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are happy and you are complaining.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Chietha...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women don't want polygamy but they want to be cheated with other single women. Who said one woman is enough for a man. In fact wives must thank husband's side-chicks because they service your husbands for your marriages to function well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Go say that to your mother
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@winniewanyoike1700 pray for your husband's side chick's because they're the main reason that your husband is happy and still keeping you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah find another man who loves you Genuinely it’s clear this he goat loves Maureen Tumbav even
q4sWUJxjc4g,These two fools will be used as firewood in hell Abraham and Maureen madness of the highest order
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oooh Lord 😳😳some Kenyan women have a big heart with so much of Tolerance , can never entertain Polygamy in my Life I hope they will review this story in the next 5, 10 years to see how they are fairing on 🤔 mayyuleedochie the wife to the Nigerian Actor Yule edochie should come and teach some Kenyan women some lessons Geez 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ when a man gets a second wife you the first wife was never an Priority, can never massage a man's Ego to accept a second wife look at how this guy is talking with pride it's as if he has done the right thing 🤢🤮"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera @6:50..woi aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Advice to Cera , You are beautiful and have a whole life ahead. You can get out of this craziness. These two are playing you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sad for the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God never give me such kind of grace. I feel for Cerah. The worst thing is that the guy is not even sensitive to her feelings. This is toxic
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow 🤣🤣🤣, Till death do us part 🤔 RIP 🙏🏽 🕊."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is a lot of fakery and sugar coating of emotions going on right here nobody is being true to how they genuinely feel abt this arrangement. I guarantee you sooner or later somebody is gonna flip. I hope Lynn does a follow up 5yrs from now, it would be interesting to see whether their living situation still remains the same as it is now."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True love
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is bulshit,may God of cera see her through,this is not your life and God will one day open your heavenly blessings and run for dear sweet,calm heart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is clear Cera is hurting its written all over her face, there is no Nice way of putting it. Favourism will there and neglect the other side. There is a reason why God made it to be two and not three. Maureen anajiforce hapo. What if the guy marries again ataskia aje. Polygamy is bad period, every child wants to see their mother loved and respected. I come from a polygamous family, the cost of this thing on children is unbearable, my mother was the first wife, dad married a second wife, sahi ako na minji minji third wife two years younger than me. The irony is that the second wife is mad, like why??? You did the same. Its has affected our  progress in life, you fear marriage, depression, my sister's education deteriorated because movement here and there and parents kuvutana, conflicts in between yaani it's bad. I promised myself I will put my children through this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ese taaaaaaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn Ngugi  let me smile while watching this but am very sure out of this interview am sure you felt a running stomach because you can tell all the red flags in this marriage ,........
1.This guy is a rich ,over confidence and a dictator  because Serah had to agree because of the conditions given to her.
2.Mareen is not telling the truth , she knew this guy was married coz from her mouth she found out that he was married ,again she said many are the time she felt afraid to go ahead with the relationship thats how God talks to us but we resist.
3. Let The guy ? Marry a third wife the second wife will bust out like a wild animal sorry.
4.serah accepting either this guy is a real head or she was just weak to appoint she can choose peace over love.
5.There body language tells alot more than the mouth does . 
6.The word of God still remain, even if the world will turn upside down.
7.sarah i know deep down you dont like it but you chose peace over love .
8.This man no words because ulicheza serah tu you two are sitting on serahs mercy ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let's not pretend, Cerah is hurting. I hope she will get enough grace to find her own happiness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera you deserve better. You're too good, too beautiful, pure heart. Maureen I hope you watched Hellen's story on LNS. You can never build happiness over someone else's home. Abraham you cheated & betrayed your wife and I don't think you love Cera. It's obvious you're in love with Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who came with this rule that its only a man who can do as he pleases?sorry guys but if I marry two men the world will shout?.make it make sense as to why you have to suffer because of a man?! Strength, #life"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Both wife are decent and we can judge any one here it’s all their destiny
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why not 2  if they agree??? What about cheating with out husband knows ?? And men with out wife knowing???? How many of you doing that ??? But he loved 2 they agreed who are you to judge???? Cheating is ok getting legal marriage is sin ??? Use ur mind ok and think well who ever say sin and he should not love 2 !!!  Are you traffic of love ??? I read the comments above that’s why I’m writing ✍️ here

q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me be thinned by mine. But hii I can’t
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hug's Cera, Marriage is for companionship, kids grow up and leave mama. You deserve so much more, may you find the strength and the courage to leave... You have been strong holding on I'm sure this strength will move you to safer spaces. I wish you true love and affection and when you leave, never look back. Hug's Cera you deserve more"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man will add 2more women since he has learned that some women are easygoing as long as you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love can never be shared  Lynn dont be deceived be careful this is very painful to Sarah.  The second woman should  quit immediately
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, leave Sera and her family alone or you will surely burn in hell. Take your child and go as far away as possible.
God bless you Sera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The difference will come ,I witnessed this in my village as we talk now the family is  no longer one . the second wife ruined the family and went away with the husband and  she has other men . what made me hate everything is that the man reached a point and stopped helping the children of the first wife yet they need education"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes out to cerah,you are so beautiful,calm and composed.I pray that you find true love and happiness.You deserve it!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She already has it
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@kisaakyebrenda4024 that's not true she is not comfortable from the look of things
q4sWUJxjc4g,You mean this is not true love?
q4sWUJxjc4g,You shouldn't had a child with a married man in the first place. It's very painful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If a man finds a better option, just give them space but start ticking the calendar.  This man holds on to Maureen  coz Serah allowed them to play her in her own house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Two heartless, narcissists, tormenting a genuine heart God can never be indefferent."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God give me strength to watch it all, because....................really, what Godly character are they teaching the children? Will the children try to understand this when they grow up? Will the parents be happy if their children follow their footsteps? Am a mother with babies; but am already feeling jealousy seeing a man cheating on my daughter. God forbid.  Repent, Jesus is coming back soon. For heaven's sake, one man, one woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ahaaaaaaaaaaa! I can't imagine what am watching! Am kind of speechless. but the fact is a man should have one wife according to the Christian walk. Guys sort yourselves out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There’s a 3rd wife coming for sure😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen leave serah family read the bible well and  repent.
q4sWUJxjc4g,But Maureen I pray you get aserous man who loves you for who you are not because of what you are coz your also agood woman I love you. But the Bible says anyone who enters in some ones marriage is acurse  remember my sister
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Such an idiotic man ...women learn to love ur selves first coz this shows low self esteem ..no sane woman can accept such nonsense 🙄

This idiotic man is a bully...I feel so upset...of coz cerah will say its well in the public eye but deep down it cnt be okay coz no sane woman can accept this idiocy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For Cera your ordained for this marriage never leave your home, you're wise look younger beautiful I even can't believe you have 3kids.  Even the devil is shaken coz his aim is to destroy marriages but you acted like God. May God bless you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen my sister with love I advise you you to come back to your senses and run for your life , honestly according to my observation the man is using you  to chase his dream but not true love. He loved Cera at the first site but for you he has so many attachment, for example  he loves because of business , because you love Cera, and still because of the support you gave support to Cera. Please your displaced ask some psychologist to help after watching this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham’s first wife is called Milly they Seperated because of cera..i guess it’s karma
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nooo! This guy is just a manipulative. Maureen resigned to her fate.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God is the same yesterday  today n forever.  His word does not change n it will never change. His word his our constitution. He does not change n he will never change to our standard.   We can sugar coat stuff but his word remain sure forever. Heaven n earth will pass away but not an iota, will be removed. Let's honour God in everything we do as he says  ""be holy in everything u do because am Holy.  We will give an account of everything before his throne. I rest my case!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is a home wrecker no matter how much they try to sugarcoat.abraham is a narcissist as much as he is bragging.this is selfishness of the highest order.cerah decided to be wise to survive ni kunoma sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,May Serah heal...it's clear she's hurting and just pulling a face..that man is a narcissist!!!!!...For Maureen only God will handle her...lakini malipo ni hapa duniani!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah and Maureen are both amazing , very beautiful, understanding and strong women however i feel they would have both flourished in their individual homes , each with their different husbands making a beautiful family ..Abraham robbed them both of that .There is a part where Abraham says all this arrangement is possible because of Maureen and the kind of person she is , i totally disagree ! i personally feel all credit should be given to Cerah for giving up her dream home , her lovely family setup , maybe her standard and her values to Accommodate Maureen ..May God be with them All😍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to Cerah! Weueeh!

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen and Abraham are trying to brush off n avoid the questions where they messed up and trying to show they had concern for Cera. Ts obvious they did Cera wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What's wrong with ths guy ...you had a beautiful, humble,.respectful woman and still go chess other woman si bado utaona wengine na vile ladies ni wengi wazuri huku nje..the guy took advantage of her politeness and he knew cerah loves him and she will accept the outcome,..wish you well cerah,..ladies don't be deceived polygamy ni disaster you can never be comfortable you live to pretend that you're OK but you're not"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"In the fullness of time everything will be more clear. God doesn't not come from anyone's village so let's stop coating with the name of God but remember the Bible says your children and children's children will face consequences of our actions so as you plant a seed just know children will reap. And again children learn from seeing and experience,this the version of marriage the children will understand, the girl Will learn it's okay to step into a marriage or it's a woman's duty to forgive,the boy will learn infidelity isn't a crime... just know they look up to you if you ask them what happiness is they can only say according to what they see from home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham should know that even Abraham of the bible respected his wife Sarah until she died. He has no respect for his first wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife look so young 🌱
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The more I rewatch it the  more get I  confused, theirs no love here."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree, its convinience."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"ALL MEN MUST MARRY SEVEN WOMEN, THAT'S THE WORD OF GOD"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki Lynn is always my best interviewer,.....hugs mummy❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who else noticed there???khaiye cerah has no ring on her finger but MAUREEN is comfortably wearing her on the figure!!! 🥲🙃🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my opinion, this is total crap!! Poor Cerah, she needs to love herself little bit more. I couldn't even finish watching this one. I just can't!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is not happy at all, she's hurting a lot, the way she breathed when Moureen was addressing the husband on how much she loves him, wawawa pole Sarah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen and Abraham you have been very mean to Cerah. Maureen Wacha kujifanya you were concerned about how cerah felt .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kama Huyu mwanamume Ana heshima Hata kidogo, Wacha hawa wamama wakae mbalimbali."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am not for polygamy but these three seem to be working things out.I am born again and I must say this polygamy was there in the Bible though it's not the best choice and in the beginning it was not so,It's not the best but according to me if there is respect,love and above all God in the picture you can withstand anything.I love the honesty in and openess.David is in heaven,Moses,Jacob.I rest my casw"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I was waiting for a genuine response when asked if they expected a 3rd wife, if I were Cera I could say"" yes, I won't be surprised to seen number 3 because I didn't see number 2 coming"" say the truth and you will be free. Hang me if you must."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a narcissist. Period.🙅🙅🙅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh yii kweli
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah looks humble, she's not happy at all, I feel like she's being  pinned down, I wonder the audacity of moureen stealing another person's man and move in the same house,,,no! Has she imagined to be in the shoes of serah?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If it can be three it can be four. Cerah get you another man. More love for everyone
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's so selfish.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing to learn from infidelity. Ati God's doing, let's not joke with the name of God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is definitely hurting you can see it in her eyes. I couldn't even watch it to the end
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How dare you Abraham, coerce these women into this madness for your selfish reasons!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No, you don’t love both of them, you’re just Egotistical , narcissistic and selfish.

You are toxic."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Be careful of work mates of opposite sex that get too close to you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As for Maureen, thank you for being very respectful! You are in the order of women like Ruth who said to Naomi, ' Your people will be my people, and you God, my God!' Because second wives are usually the problem when they meet an accommodating first wife. They start acting selfish and jealous and make life difficult for the first wife  but your friendship with Sera tells me that you too are Godfearing! May God continue to bless you all!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think that those who think Sera is in trouble, are merely projecting their own insecurities on her. She is absolutely impressive from what I see. She is a child that has been reared by God. Sera, please continue being this unselfish! You are at the Frontline of showing us the Beaty of Grace! God's daughter, you are something else and I love you already!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These are very beautiful people! They are all mild mannered and realistic! Most importantly, they are not greedy. I bet they are all God-fearing! Both women are exceptionally very respectful! I think this is a doing of God to make us know that if people are the forgiving type, there is nothing impossible! I believe their love is nearer unconditional than most married people's kind of love, because love is not selfish - Corinthians 13 kind of love. Love is not self- seeking. Abraham, you are blessed to have truly spiritually mature women. Their love type is not flesh based buy spiritual. I never thought I would live to see this kind of thing but now that I have seen it, I am truly happy and I will pray for you all and your children to continue being blessed with this kind of love. You guys have all learned to control your demons, i.e., if you have any! Thank you for sharing!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are stupid to believe God blesses this madness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you are beautiful get your own husband please
q4sWUJxjc4g,Devil is a liar.And the three of you have accepted to campaign for him.Repent.🙏🏿.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen that is not your husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you have surrendered your destiny so easily to another woman. Why are you letting go your God given blessing. Go on your knees, cry out to God and claim back what is yours and God will help you. Otherwise ...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't smile about the story. Sarah has just buried her head in the sand. God hates an adulterous relationship no matter how much you embellish it. It is all lie
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ain’t nothing wrong with marrying as many wives if you can afford to take care of them. Even our forefathers did this when monopoly had not been introduced to them and they lived in harmony. The only mistake is to put them in the same house it’s like Hutu and Tusi definitely they will come some jealousness one way or another.  He has done a good thing in a way saving those women from raising their children by themselves which was a matter of give and take ……. they didn’t have a choice esp Poor Cera. Let all those men out there with kids take responsibility as well for crying out loud.  If not they need to be more rules for them to pay child support.  There’s no child that comes to this world without a biological dad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If all is Well and normal Like you say, why then should there be jealosy.  Polygamy is no good! Some men Support IT because IT IS for their own pleasure."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Reading through the comments, I find it funny how some people would rather see this family broken, just because it does not conform to their standards. I personally think that with the children involved, they made a really responsible decesion, and to see how much they love and respect each other, its a great show of maturity."
q4sWUJxjc4g,At least one sensible comment.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Children grow up & leave their parents so what happens after that??
q4sWUJxjc4g,One can coparent
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just got to watch this today and truth be told, Cera is a strong and forgiving woman. For her to have been able tolerate this is shocking. Mimi I would have walked away from the man who does this to me and especially if there are kids involved. Women need to be able to be bold enough to walk away from toxic relationships- because this is absolutely disrespectful and hurtful to say the least, even to the most gracious of us. 

God help us and our daughters."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True sister that is right God will surely help you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,When a man is having money he provides  his responsibility there is no problem
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is happening all over the world so it is no surprise you have some man 4 or more wifes
q4sWUJxjc4g,sodom ad gomo..................may God open you eyes
q4sWUJxjc4g,I give much respect to Sera because if she had not welcomed her she shouldn't have been there
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If your wife and you did not have prior agreement that they will in future accommodate other people in the marriage ,anything other than that is manipulation and betrayal.however the betrayed party has choices either to reject the  introduction of adulterous relationship  within the marriage, or fear the unknown and accept the fate.the latter is what happened here and this acceptance legitimizes the intruder  (Maureen) and the manipulator (Abraham)'s action"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen Toka nyumba ya Sarah tell your husband to build you a house
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a pathetic marriage, Cerah is undergoing tough times believe me love is Jelously Abraham its too..too.. heartless doing this. May God protect cera all through. Maureen walk out and get your man .infact you are a great pretender"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have tears in my eyes this man is just a blessed man may God bless your relationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't get to understand this story but Cerah seems to be in a lot of inner pain and thoughts..not judging her but it's hard to see it as plain truth
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank GOD to our legendary camera man , all of them can lie but we can see the eyes and even how the makeup has been done , the smudged lipstick on SERAH"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Both women are victims of Abraham's selfishness. He concealed his marriage from Maureen until he knew she was entangled and even after she said no he pursued her. I sense Maureen was a socially isolated woman and it's easy to fall for a man like Abraham. Also, Cera, the most wronged in this situation, it's just unfortunate for these two women their lives are entangled in this mess"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love the little gods commenting and judging on the family....... Keyboard worriers
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing to judge on my side, what God has plan in our life nobody knows, peace luv and unity that's important,, congratulations Abraham udid your best like aman,, ♥️💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Someone told me if he truely loves you he will never go for another  and if he does he dont love you. 🙄 I don't ger it I love both 😂 😂 not me ooh kudos to cerah I can take it to that extent mimi a simple text I will react kama hydrochloric acid mixed with all things in the world 😂 😂 😂 now am imagining bringing in another one wueeeeh no no no for me, am even scared to start with a man from scratch nkt and then another woman comes in I can't take that 😂 😂 not me I pitty this lady but najua she knows what she is doing just a matter of time ⌚ may God see her through aki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woow cute family,i love the way walikubali kustay together hadi wamefanya nika admire marriage Yao."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God is the judge...waswahili wanasema nyumba zinaficha mengi.either way we don't know maybe kwa ground vitu nipoa ama sipoa..alafu kwetu wataita Huwa tunasema bibi wawili nikama chungu Cha uchawi..mahali uyo Abraham atakufia hatajua....anyways siwez judge
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wonder if roles were reversed and Maureen was the first wife if she'd do the same for Ceera? Also, They've only lived together for a year.. that's waaay too short of a time to actually conclude that this arrangement is truly working. This is a ticking time bomb 😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sometimes when we are in happens, we have to think outside of flesh but spiritual form ,which accommodates & reach out to embrace  a judicial  platform and see the  prosperity of the lessor ones , kids  laughter & joy is no.1.  & honor to the manhouse eventhough somewhere they don't hold him fair'  .U re all very pretty wives, God rewards the finisher of the journey through it All."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is Soo selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂🌅🌅🌅💟💟💟🙏🙏🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,After Hellen Anindo shared her story I have no doubts whatsoever that someone is misplaced here.I wish one day she will come to her senses and realise that..May guilt and conviction follow her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is an emotional guiness. He knows what women need and he can add more women in the picture if he wants and they will all get along and that is so sad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ur girls are look alike eehh' truely beauty in eyes facially  babemanas of cool.  Of Abraham house ooh , Blessings of God'"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If your peaceful ways lead & control your house in a God-fearing man ' we don't judge none '
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn this people want to spoil your channel with useless story they have nothing to tell us just shameless
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wawawaaaa!!!
Maureen, there's nothing to explain here and it's never too late to do the right thing. Please move away from another woman's marriage and let God work on yours."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To where now? Remember there's an innocent kid involved here. Am in the same situation and am going nowhere for the sake of my son. We know each other but we can't stay together. Me i never knew he has a baby mama and so long as i can't drain his blood from my son then we will raise him tukiwa wote. Anyway you won't understand like you haven't been in such shoes you won't know how it feels
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@ladyjay1005 Experience is the best teacher. God has good plans for each one of us...and children are His gifts to us. In such cases, We like hiding behind our children by living in sin and remember, it's not you and that man taking care of that child without His hand. Siz, it's draining and painful but God has a way of mending life when you sacrifice to leave sin and wholly lean on Him.
I admire that lady Hellen and until I listened to her experience, I always thought I was the only one. For the sake of your destiny and your generation, cling to your creator, take the BOLD step and and move out. *I HAVE BEEN THERE* !!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He was cheating while the wife is pregnant...it is so declassified!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy just found himself a good cleaner and he did want to lose that. 'Please don't go' was not because he loved her but the convinence she came with.......
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like the questions Lynn asks lol
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sin is sin it should not be sugar coated.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy and its effects weeuh  .living with bitterness especially  the first family and kids ..this is a definite no.Please women don't help men to justify their infidelity. 
Anyway to each their own .am not judging but Cera looks hurt deep inside like she didn't have a choice 😕
I will never grow my kids in such a set up in the name of marriage.The other women are selfish 
Men are selfish. This is a pure narcissist like someone I knòw.
See the pain in Cerah !"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is controlling,manipulative,selfish pure NARCISSIST! hope Cera can find the courage to walk out of this madness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I almost found myself in that but I thank God it didn't go that way
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm sorry but Abraham is a narcissist.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am just glad that he is able to put them on the same table
q4sWUJxjc4g,This clown of a man telling Maureen she's done very well helping cera like that is normal.. he's on an Ego trip!!! Praying for Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is nothing but a selfish idiot! Honestly speaking, my heart goes out to Serah! She is yet to heal from her trauma. She accepted this because she felt she didn't have a choice because she already had kids with him. Baby girl, you do have a choice! Abraham and Maureen had no reason to disrespect you in this manner. He took advantage of your quiet and calm nature to cheat on you and marry his adulterous partner. Stop being quiet, so that they do not trample upon you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is not okay at all the facial expression tell a lot but for you Maureen its not right at all Sera cannot say here but things aren't right there
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hate this. I cant watch this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is evil. The husband, 2nd wife and their children will one day cry premium tears. The 1st wife must be hurting real bad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera hasn’t accepted, her introduction says it all, I expected “I’m first wife to……” and the Maureen one if she ain’t ashamed of her doing, she needs not to omit the “SECOND wife” in her introduction!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn i wish you could have asked Maureen if hypothetically she would be ok for a third wife coming into their lives,because they are trying so hard to absolve themselves of the hurt they brought to Cera.It broke my heart hearing her say that she is not a person who normally gets lucky in life"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't know why am so disturbed by Abraham and Maureen acting like the end justifies the means!
Maureen slept with Abraham knowing he had a wife, and caring very little about what consequences their actions  would have on the marriage.
It's just a coincidence that cera accepted and built on the infidelity.. but again, am not convinced cera feels deep down that they did right by her
It's okay that it's working now,but it will always remain that Maureen is a home wrecker, because the home cera shared with the husband died.. she now must share everything,but the choice was initially not hers, it was made for her by Abraham and Maureen
That will never change"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that cera, who only found out about her hubbys affair when her baby saw a photo of Maureen's baby on the phone, has accepted this situation does not make it right
I feel like cera is still in the process of taking all this in, and maybe for now,her only option is to accomodate Maureen, so as not to lose completely. ...but the whole truth is deep somewhere in her heart
Because she didn't have a choice
Her only choice after being cheated on was lose her whole marriage,or accept whatever piece of himself the husband had decided to reserve for her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter what Abraham says love is never shared between two. The one who do not belong to the family will leave at sometime.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Looks like its maureen and Abraham show.Cerah looks quiet.Looks to me Maureen and Abraham are pulling the rugs under our feet and making themselves look good
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is nothing beautifull about all this crap🙄🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if Cera brings another 4th party....he he?!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At least u are man enough to be honest than to hide it..most men out there have side chicks and even kids,th most painful thing is u will only find out abt that side chick nd kids wen his dead"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The moment Cerah said she was eager to see Maureen because Abraham spoke highly about her 🙆🏽‍♀️woi i just feel her pain🙃 i can’t entertain that, stop telling me about your side chic selfish man that’s so disrespectful period!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,damn thas one lucky nigga
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy from the word go never married any of the ladies out of love. He married Serah because she could clean his house and tidy the place. Then he married Maureen because she was favoring his business. This guy only thought of himself in the whole process.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen as a second wife in future you will never have a moral authority to guide and educate your children in a right way, and also your consciousness to pray to God 🙆🏽‍♀️ (thank you God for my husband woi)it’s really disturbing knowing you took another woman husband. 
Polygamy is recorded in the Bible but it’s not recommended. Serah may God give you more grace to handle this for me it’s a NO."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel Cera.... she even thought of moving her home closer to NBI
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am a victim too but ,with deadbeat daddy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wooow beautiful. I respect yall.D maturity displayed  by d ladies,cerah so calm and d man is so happy and moureen is cool too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's trying sugar coat sin(infidelity being called good names)carah hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,😄 🤣 😂 😆 😄 🤣 very nice interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They're laughing now but the day they will meet their maker they will answer. Their daughters and sons will grow confused and even if they decide to take a controversial life like gaysim or lesbiniansm, the parents won't have a moral right to advice them. Some of this decisions are very selfish and they are lend by lust. They affect future generations. YOU ARE NOT ROLE MODELS TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. period!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One thing is for sure, Abraham will go for a third wife. Soon he will meet a brown girl who is more rich and he will go for her. He is a real Abraham father of nations.😆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaah the guy is handsome, though kiguyu ain't that much in polygamy,am against polygamy but what to do"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The whole situation never happened because the man wanted a second wife, it happened because the other lady got pregnant and things escalated. Any man who uses his children to manupulate the mother is big 🚩🚩flag..



Any who's, I just hope time will tell and I will be wrong about this. ✌️ Let us all do what makes us happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This one man will..have a side chiiiik  trust you me he will..put one undercover...once a cheat always acheat...you cheated on your wife b4 even one year with serah together..really..???now you moreen promote women to cheat and be sec wives...kweeendaaaaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Benjamin Zulu, plz come and help Cerah!    Uuuuwi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,unable to finish watching this one aki. Her pain....sigh.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Whenever I sit to listen to this,,I can't really finish it,,it's so hard to listen till end coz it doesn't make sense to me,,me I can't accept this thing.. no matter how they paint it good..it's a no to me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😭😭😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He's will suffer, na bado."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"33 minutes in, he's annoying 🙄 really Maureen will suffer. I pray for Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are discussing Serah like she is not there.And its clear the only marriage here  is btn Abraham and Maureen.Also notice the change of tone when Abraham is talking about  Maureen,his voice is gentle and warm.Serah is the third wheel."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy interrupts serah when she is talking but not maureen.another redflag
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God have mercy on Serah , I pity her .."
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sad watching a man justify his selfishness on such a platform...give him a few more years he is going to bring in a third wife....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"OK. Let’s turn the tables…
What if Cerah moved out of Abraham’s house and got her own apartment, then got another man to live with her, and tells Abraham he is free to join them in their home as a partner?!
Are men just taking advantage of women? Men are entitled and women dare not? This is utter disrespect for the female species…."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And do you think there is even a single man who can do that???that proves that men are deadly selfish😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Obviously not really possible , I really feel bad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is not biblical. You may sanitize it but it's not a God's idea
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife body language Talks alot. She is Not happy at All. She is Not happy!! Second wife is so happy laughing too loud but first noo
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't mean to be judgemental but if living together came as an initial plan it would have been okay but the fact that a baby came and yet the relationship was still a secret is a no. Serah just had to accept it as she had already started a family with her and had met the family. Maureen seems to be talking over Serah or just consoling and justifying herself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't  just stand this.mr man in my life ,kindly don't try this at home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hmmmmm l feel  sorry  for Sera  ,she is deeply  hurting yet pretending  to be happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaaaah Earth is hard surely it's true that no one can love two at a go who has heard moureen saying that she felt bad when she found about baby pendo she was heart broken yet goes ahead and accept to have a baby with another womans husband without considering her feelings ,,,,, selfishness wait until Abraham goes out and bring third wife becoz he is still young n energetic"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We need to review this family after five years @Lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cant finish this interview, this man has no  regard for his wife's feelings. He is proud and enjoying this attention so much and i can't stand it. No offense to you Lynn, i will watch other episodes to the end."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah I feel you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Empowering our girls is  the key 🔑
q4sWUJxjc4g,I will never accept a second wife this is total foolishness serah ametuangusha as ladies akubali alichezwa serah looks bright but stupid at the same time so UNGODLY 👎
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Total. Absolutely mess before GOD. These ladies are truely in pain behind the smiles. What a messy bed. Messy home. I can't even watch it no more. What is GOD saying though ?  OMG. Some women are desperate !! Is it for money. Big house, fame , sex?.what it is ?.  I have no confident that i am willing to fall in second place ? Gosh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like listening to this man. He's selfish and trying hard to justify his infidelity to Cera. Bye
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen wasn't honest here. Lynn did a good job. You see,he didn't tell Maureen that he was married bcos he didn't want to lose her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham says you have to look beyond love. Never heard that before. Maureen isn't honest. She would have preferred Abraham sending Cera away
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am sending cerah alot of light and 💕 love
q4sWUJxjc4g,"waaaaaah,this earth iko na mambo, that's what l can say....."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@m.cdeborde8483 Thank you, I will try cc."
q4sWUJxjc4g,All I can say the guy took advantage of Sarah's weekness/calmness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,So true 🙂
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah has said she has never had luck other than him, woi I don't want to judge her bt that tells alot......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True, he is selfish, very selfish. I hope Cerah's eyes open and she moves out of this situation. Huyu mwanamme hampendi. She seems very ambitious and I know she can do well without them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Total bullshit.i can't,I won't.second wives are just elevated sidechics, sidechics are proud homebreakers"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceral your so beautiful jamani kwanini unakubali hii situation tena in one house why bora ungemwachilia aende Hugo kwa huyo Maureen kids kids  how. And Maureen jitadhimini unachafua hali ya hewa kwa.nyumba ya mwenzio. Abrahamu umemkosea sana Ceral after all she is beautifully why this to her. Wacha kutaja Mungu kwa hii Abrahamu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"aki lynn "" how about loooove ....i still love you"" ...

q4sWUJxjc4g,if she was really a woman wife to this man where did thr chanve of getting secord one came from
q4sWUJxjc4g,two desparate ladies who have never tested true  love ..just seeing a romantic handsome man infront of them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a pig, no matter what it's given, haitosheki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a narcissistic man. He doesn’t care about Cera or her feelings. And Maureen is also heartless. Karma will get Maureen and this man. There is nothing as hurtful as knowing you have been betrayed in a relationship. Cera hides her pain behind her smile.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera.. is so beautiful. Moureen looks older than her. Sera is not happy. She has just learned to live with it
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Everyone has there own weakness, am not perfect 👌 let me not speak anything negative or positive. God above all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,First you cheated on her.you  lie her.so if Sera did not find the picture in the phone ungeshow. abraham your not honest and  the worse thing ni  you let  them stay in the same house  ata kama yes my grandfather was a polygamy with 3 wives kila mtu alikuwa anakaa kwake but trust me you the love was not that much juu ilifika a point  love die like kupenda wanawake watatu aje sasa  ...woiye serah I can feel you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yaani covid took so many people and missed this man???sad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This was painful to watch…it’s your life though..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This MAN, I repeat THIS MAN will get another lady and they will be three...SHIDA huanza once the kids are old.... Moto itawaka Kwa hiyo nyumba..  MADNESS , I don't have words,Serah should just GO"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lovely story,lovely and blessed couple.I love that confidence from both ladies.May God bless their marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Finally I came across the +ve comment that I was looking for
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Irene, thank you for that positive support and gesture toward them. That's what we need from our women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just what Father Abraham did with hagga..waaa!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The word of God will never change,it doesn't matter how you glorify the sin. .. Sarah may God give you strength, continue praying in your hidden place, the vegence of GOD will surely come for your aid. Hebrews 7:2.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapo sasa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"“ I wear ironed socks,” the perks of having two wives! This Abraham guy, woooi hapana jameni🫢. Also how this guy says that he woke up and found cerah having cleaned his house and that’s how he decided to be with Cerah says a looooot about this guy. He even feel the need to jump in on every question that’s asked sijapenda 🥹🥹. Ladies, please just stop slaving to get a man. You’re the real babyghurl. Before you clean please just know your position in someone’s life.  This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to watch but if it makes them happy whomst am I?🥹"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly. He found her cleaning and decided she's the woman to live with him. 🧐 So wasn't it love??
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I felt the same energy too....
This nigga is just a loser!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart literally sinks!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Please God, give Sera peace that surpasses human understanding....... she looks traumatized but she has a beautiful heart.....the reason she's accommodating Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen stop the lies..sure u did destroy cerah's home ..u still have achance to have ur own home..cerah is crying in silence n for sure u will reap some days
q4sWUJxjc4g,U can't save two masters at the same time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How complicated marriage is with just two people…..now add the third!
When Abraham walks in at the end of the day, where does he rest! Where does he place his belongings? How does he choose with whom to spend a night?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know how to fake like cerah juu weeeh nijikute
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope one day serah will tell her story without sugar coating it. May God give her the Grace
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is in so much pain...not yet healed
q4sWUJxjc4g,@junior exactly 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@carolinentinyari6652 she will never heal from that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The strongest heart has the most scars. Cerah, we feel for you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so hard to watch .
q4sWUJxjc4g,You did not have to accept that lady
q4sWUJxjc4g,This first wife tolerated alot from these 2
q4sWUJxjc4g,If she was a good woman you should have respected her and be faithful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah you're the best..... you deserve peace ✌️...... Maureen feel shameful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The outside woman thinking about the wife but not the husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,He sounds real good but he is a selfish man
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can you look beyond love to love...foolishness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't love two person at the same time...Selfish man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can see the first wife is hurting..This man is sick
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mungu mimi sitaki vitu kama hizi 😭😭 Cerah may God fight for you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't  think another woman understands this nonsense  Next person that speaks politely  will be the 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,He had to be cheating on his first wife before she knew about the second one.What got into these two women HEAD..... BIG SELFISH MAN
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bado una sura mzuri tu tafta wako husband toka kwa kwenyewe and stop pretending that uko happy when you are 100% wrong  life side
q4sWUJxjc4g,How comes Maureen looks older than Sera? And let's not glorify infidelity and adultery! SIN IS SIN!!🥺🥺🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,I even thought Maureen was the first wife..little did I know cera was the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's even older than that man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well said let's not glorify SIN at all.i was looking for this age comment, wueh!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@teammichele5520 hehe
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@teammichele5520😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,My friend stop wasting your time on another woman life..you still young enda tafta bwana wako wengi sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think this man is selfish .What is love?When you love a person you will commit to them but because of your selfishness you want 2 women. Yes it is a show indeed.What have we taught our girls? Both yours? Give me a break.Women are hurting and dmiling.I will never sit here and think things are ok with you 3.God is against this three way nonsense. Example of eating your cake and wanting it 2
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So, what makes Maureen think he won't buy coffee for somebody else 🤔😕😐🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God help Cerah & fight for her aggressively.
This man said he has no regrets. 
Vengeance belongs to God. Its wrong how they laugh. You are not helpless."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is having his cake and eating it too . He likes using people He doesn’t love any of one of them. He loves Sarah because she takes crap and is a homemaker and Maureen has a business mind. Otherwise this whole set up is sad .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maybe we women should practice polyandry as well. This is the only way everyone will win.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a selfish man and sorry to say, this ends up with him and Maureen staying together"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lakini wanaume hukua too funny ...what is it that cera was not giving you that moureen gave you ????  Kutulia too na mtu mmoja ni shida ? ....Mimi nayo this can't work ...na Niko sure hakuna hata happiness hapa ...pthoooo...my opinion though
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if this becomes an insatiable desire to have more wives?
q4sWUJxjc4g,🙄what in bullshit’s name is this???! Formalizing lies and then telling the story with pride?!🤬
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am not yet married but I won't make any persons daughter pass through this... Help me God
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,God help you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am like acha hizi bills ziniue but I ain't dating a married man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow you sound like a  man👍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceerah is being used by this woman marriage reckerrrrr....OMG🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Morren get out of that family as soon as possible, you are playing with fire , the word of God is very clear about marriage  its only death can separate them not human and from you case  it's like you're death to this family God is watching toka b4 the wrath of God catch up with you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A very selfish man. He's not letting Ceerah express her point always interjecting her.
Ceerah I feel forrrr....uuuu💔💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😿💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So, when is Abraham introducing #3?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham got  caught with infidelity.  You cannot make a wrong be right. Maureen's nature is multiple characteristics.  Pushing Cera slowly by the day. The card's will eventually fall with TIME.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Stand up Cerah! Stand up!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Red flags detected.Cerah is not happy.Nobody would be happy in such a situation.Sometimes when Sarah wants to open up Abraham will cover up n say ""let me help her"";how can he speak out what is in Cera's inner pain?It is absolute that Abraham loves Maureen more.In most cases Cera has a ""plastic smile"".Her inner thoughts r miles away."
q4sWUJxjc4g,💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what stops you from marrying a third wife 😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Open book with Cerah?! Abraham you are a liar……you run a relationship with another woman all the way to having a child together and you claim you had an open book relationship with your wife?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Matters worse, you never disclosed your infidelity. Cerah discovered it by herself. What is your definition of an open book relationship?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish men knows the way we feel when he break your trust with him you feel very small but you just pretend to be happy with what he has done
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most men only consider marrying a second wife after the first wife has worked hard with him to get money
These men the have the guts to bring a second one
Mbona hukumuoa kama hauna pesa?
Now she is coming to enjoy what you guys worked for
Nkt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, there are many beautiful women out there. When will you say this is enough? How many are enough?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a very selfish guy. Infidelity. He cannot even explain to Cerah straight up what he was up to when he was away from home late…it’s wrong!
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are basically calling God stupid.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That Man should be ashamed of Himself,to even to talk and sgow his face. He is lost"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wueehh,,,, if a man can love a different woman yet he has another one thats not love,,,,if he loved first wife hangepata chance ya kupenda uyu mwingine...🙂🙂🙂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have some personal reservations about polygamy. However, on the Abraham's family story, I beg to differ with the claim that it is right and they are okay. For one to determine whether or not polygamy is right, they should also answer the same question when it comes to polyandry. Abraham says that he has two wives because he loves them both and can provide for them both. In my opinion, men who allow polygamy are patriarchal in nature and do not believe in gender equality. I say so because, men who support polygamy, or are in polygamous marriages would not be as supportive if the matter was polyandry. If you asked Abraham if it would be okay for him to allow Cerah to love another man and bring the other man to live with them in the same house, if she was the one providing, I do not think his response would be positive. 

Men who are polygamous would flip if they imagined any of their women with another man, why? Why the double standards? Why would men feel okay to subject their wives to polygamy if they cannot want to be subjected to polyandry. Abraham messed up by cheating on his wife and has justified his actions by coercing Cerah to accept and embrace Maureen. It is true they have managed to work it out on their terms. However what Abraham and Maureen did is still wrong. Just because with learn to shut our conscience to accept the wrong or hurtful things we do does not make the actions right. Human beings are selfish in nature, no one would want to share that which belongs to them, let alone a lie partner. Lets give it time, things will unravel. 

Cerah and Maureen should be warned. A man who gives in to his urges still has the capability even in future. There are many handsome and beautiful people we see and love everyday, but it does not compel us to invite them into our lives as life partners. This is all about self-discipline and control, qualities I believe Abraham lacks."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing to be proud of....Just forced happiness and plastic smiles.....To young girls don't be encouraged to be a homewreckers don't justify the wrong doings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"THIS GUY IS A NO! TOTAL HYPOCRITE. EXAMPLE OF A BAD MAN. CERAH, you are hiding so much. Maureen no comment, time will tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't even watch the whole of this video. It's hearbreaking to see how man has managed to turn the will of God to suit there own will. The only person benefiting from this disgraceful marriage is the man, you can see how he brags that he has respect from people because of them. May God open the eyes of these two women  it doesn't even matter how long it will take but their eyes will surely open, we serve a living and patient God."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacha tu. I have to fast forward some parts because 😒😒...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ujinga tuu God never shared his Glory,there can never equal love UONGO POLYGAMY IS A CURSE.OFCOS U ARE A HOME BREAKER GOD TOOK 1 RIB NOT 2.I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT MEN WANT EXCEPT BIENG  OPPORTUNIST,oooh CEERA IBRAIM N HAGAI."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn,this gentleman is just trying to nurse his ego by saying Serah is okey. If the Bible says the husband should have one wife, that's it. Abraham is lying that he loves the two ladies equally."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don't lie to us you are okay,no woman wishes to share a man, you are there for your own interests"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waahh hiyo kiherehere ya kuoshea mtu nyumba na nguo mimi sina nguvu 😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,This beautiful Cerah is yet to heal..woiye she's still hurting 😭😭😭😭.  Let's be honest
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you brought coals in ur life.U might never find peace.U having maureen is purely lust.Both ur women are suffering emotional but says they are friends to cover up.
They are together coz u never wanted2 loose them.From ur story n feelings u look guilty n maureen2, Sara just stayed 2 hold her home.Deeply touched by sara."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don’t care what anyone says, Cerah is still hurting..I wouldn’t stay, but am not her..If Inwas Maureen I would tread carefully…"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mbona naona maureen ni mzee kwa cerah ama macho yngu mbaya izi brandnew second hand hua c zipendi
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't think this right no human can love two people can a woman have two husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sorry Cerah for what that man did to you! Hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sorry Cerah for what that man did to you! Hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is asked what attracted him to Cera and he finds it difficult to answer that simple question. In response to the question, he has to include Maureen. How dare he, “ it’s because she’s light in complexion, as you can see they are both light in complexion and she’s bla bla bla”, he can’t even mention that she’s beautiful but he’s quick to say Maureen is very very beautiful and even gives her more attributes. Even the way he opens up about Maureen to his wife was more protective of keeping Maureen rather than keeping his wife. Cera deserves better she’s a very good and beautiful woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wooiiieee I felt the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,i have read almost all the comments and women wako na machungu about there situation.before we were westarnized our religion beliefs and our family opinions were taken away from us this is how our women lived bana .
q4sWUJxjc4g,And what proof do you have polygomous worked back then
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've read all comments too. It's just common sense two women can't live together in the same house. Even in kikuyu they are called airu from the word wiru which means jealousy. We surely dint inherit the word airu from the wazungus
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are they asking when they started living together....this man is a no
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah feels the pain but hid it behind to get enough tension from the man and love of kids to have both parents yet deep she shed tears unlike maureen who see things are okay with both. i understand how feels i once did the same to my husband accepted to bring his side chick for lunch,the go out together, lady buy clothes for my son, thinking she is the only one, behavior extended to more ladies over the years and excuse he could give the ladies was ""MY WIFE IS SOFT AND LOVING SHE WOULD DO NO HARM TO YOU"" Became his habit that led me to seriously diagnosed with ulcers in name of loving and want to keep the marriage. i was almost dying inside but people thought am strong and happy. after several years, i have to divorce and now am happy, health, no stress and all those he thought were special, blessing to him,can be second and third finally left him and now he has started wanting me back.after period of an a year."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No woman should go through what Cera is going through... Watch your husband discribe a fellow woman this way right in front of you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Upuzi
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love those sentiments at the beggining 😁
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing hurts like knowing that the person you loved and trusted so much is out there sleeping with another person who us unapologetic. The fact that this girl is called maureen reminds me of the Maureen that ruined my marriage. Its been 10 months and i have never recovered. I can feel the pain in cerahs eyes😭😭😭. There is no God in coming  to ruin another persons happines however much you try to justify it. Karma will deal with you maureen. You dont belong there, STOP FORCING IT!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true I've learnt this from my family many years and still my mum hurts and my dad loves our second mum more😭😭😭bt there is a God in heaven
q4sWUJxjc4g,Perfectly said
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true my sister
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true liz
q4sWUJxjc4g,"how did u read ma mind liz,,,I hate this type of ladies who force themselves to ppo's husbands....I pray karma on them  may thunder kill them one day,,,nonsense"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So he was ready to loose cera💔...cera run
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The moment serah said she has never been lucky says it all,but stay strong everything happens with a reason"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,...it seems like she had so many deceptions in her life that she completely forgot her worth/ value.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I felt it too. Too bad she's not given that much attention as the second wife despite spending a lot of time with the second wife at work.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man loves Maureen so much. He has over protected her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also noticed as the first wife introduced herself, he was just staring, but all smiles when Maureen was introducing herself"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham: m a strong believer, christian...😃😃😃😃my foot"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueh, noo... Sioni nikimaliza, the pretence, the selfishness. Don't bring the name of the God in this set up. We pray."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Upusi mwingi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Once you didn't make jesus your saviour, you'll definitely fall into such a mess. If sarah had prayed for her home, repented from a marriage out of the church, all this wldnt have happened to her. This s adultery pattern following her.

She needs to repent and get delivered, her and her daughters otherwise they too will succumb the same fate 😭😭😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My own opinion, this is a guy who cheated on his wife, and the wife does not yet have the guts to leave. I am hoping one day she will have the courage to leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa naona this guy took advantage of cera's calmness..woiye i wish i had a heart like hers
q4sWUJxjc4g,"hhhhhhhhh it s a generation to generation pattern hhhhh Abrah+Sarah and here comes. a concubine hhhhhhh

From the way he keeps licking his lips, this man is a womanizer (psychology tells)

Women dont wait longer. The 3rd wife is on the way🤷‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"love has no borders ,its all about chemistry. its possible to love more than one person."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ametega masikioo 😆ndege ipite
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn asking the questions as they are supposed to be asked. Love from Malawi🇲🇼
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's so good at what she does

q4sWUJxjc4g,Woiye sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,And am very sure this man has more women out there
q4sWUJxjc4g,Team cera all the way
q4sWUJxjc4g,Team cera all the way
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man doesn't love Serah at all 😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,What do people learn from this story ???not productive
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love how Lynn does leave any detail.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The audacity, no remorse for what they have done, breaks my heart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is not right,all is fake . Cira looks that she will revenge both.Because ciras facial expression doesn't look ok"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wait so beside being unfaithful or horsing as we say in the Caribbean..you gave your wife an ultimatum..REALLY!!!! He has no clue what love is!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow..okay so a 3rd is on the way or already there! 2nd wife you are of little value as a so called wife no matter how you speak or portray yourself you are someone that 2 timed another woman! This guy is so proud and selfish and does not  care about anyone these ladies. Going beyond 'love' REALLY!!! You are to love your wife..nonsense you that guy, you are no husband you are a business man and seeking to have a 'company' for your needs under your roof. Disgusting!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To you Lynn congratulations,you have mature questions, this interview was that easy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera mama , betrayal pain is written all over your face, follow your heart you not at the right place"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most of the people in the comment section haven't finished watching the whole video  🤦🏾‍♀️🙆🏾‍♀️. The two ladies are actually very okay. I am sure they apologize to Serah everyday for what they did and that's why this is working. You can tell they are okay just from watching their interactions it is so genuine. 

Human beings though 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ dumdums*"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes out to Cerah.This woman is bold and beautiful in and out.You are short of options.You are still hurt.The deep breaths you take before you speak says it all.May the good Lord give you peace ✌️.Hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True ,  she is strong mm siwezi akh ata ka nakupenda aje"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you are so wonderful in this interview you should reach millions subscribers
q4sWUJxjc4g,"?Cerah i don't know what kind the woman is you ,how you can support all this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dey are not genuinely happy deep down dere is great regret but dey wont say it out.U cant no better dan God dat said one man one woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is striking me as someone who likes men too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I rarely comment but for this I need too
Go back to the roots of how God designed marriage it’s purely one man one woman…….see what happened to Haggai in the Bible God himself allowed Abraham to chase her with her son . All I can say is it’s not too late for moreen to start and get your own man. It’s hell for two women to be under one roof Plis work on it now before tragedy 👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mstewwww
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sad so sad for Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One) it is actually not fun living without a dad. My dad is alive but doesn’t keep in touch since my mum didn't want him in my life. So yeah it's a tough journey and we get lost on the process coz mum ako job i can do what i want kinda thing and ofcause end up in hell... where else??? But worry not, now i am born again and holy spirit led.... 

2) God has used Abraham empire to bring hope and healing to all women n men out there (in Kenya). Some men have the urge to have more than one wife but becoz of the sin and fear of owning up to that, women fighting each other, and all that, men have ended up leaving their 1st wives. 2nd wives not wanting the man to talk to the 1st wife... please God is using Abraham to bring you hope and confidence in your hardships. Accept the other woman and make peace when it happens. Ofcause we re jealous n Don't want to hear of 2nd wife, but for peace and happiness, accept the facts and live a holy life. 

Remember God favoured HagA and her son, Ishmael, in the wilderness * who re u to judge!!!! Islamic religion comes from Ishmael heritage. And Christianity lineage of Isaac other son to Abraham... 😇😇😇

3) men if you keep more than one wife, don't be a broke kid putting your wives and children in a hell of a life. If u can't afford, keep your sperms and feelings to yourself. Go work hard then make a move. Bring honour and respect to your Sir name! 

4) God's wisdom is foolishness to men. So if u Don't understand this or think it's foolish, read your  bible extensively!!! Sawa sawa! Bye for now! God continue to bless Abraham   empire!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't know this man but i hate him already,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've been to toughest roads & back hustled in gulf & survived what would make me lower myself this much .... Lynne sorry but this i wouldn't wish it for anyone God let me never be this desperate

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am wondering where and how people re seeing pain in Cerah!!!! People stop putting your personal emotions as if ni za Cerah!!! I don't see that in Cerah!!! Wacheni kuchochea vitu negative. She will never leave but grow old with Abraham and Morine*.... he is a responsible man unlike many out there who leave n block or throw out another wife to bring another..
 Please respect Abraham for being a true Man!!!! End of story kenyans!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The sad part about this is how Maureen acts like she cared about what Sarah would think.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is sad to watch. Sarah is not healed. She is still in pain. At 44.18 she is fighting tears. This man is an idiot.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a professional narcissistic and I don't support him at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sending love to Serah 💌💌💌💌

q4sWUJxjc4g,Life can be so amazing and so complicated. Better these ones who are adapting and accepting their choices than the rest of us with our messiness hiding in darkness #adulting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Imagine over 75% of men are non monogamous. So long as over 75% of women aren't willing to stay single. Sharing men is a thing. Even women in monogamous marriages share men knowingly or unknowingly.  You dump a cheat for another cheat. Still, not all men cheat but most do."

Thanks"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen says ""at this point I've not accepted him"" but she keeps going out with him, as if she has a heart made of stone.. hmm and for the guy, he says ""it's beyond love"", yes, it is infidelity tolerated."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh My God! I don't have this level of generosity, I want my man to myself and can't settle for someone else coming in and acting as if we are one big family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But we cannot have sex daily......
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shame on them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow this is the Abraham at last we meet you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woisheee Serah,may God give you the grace to leave one day.No way this situationship is healthy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The un asked question is, how is the Penis timetable?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Shame on you Moureen,you are a husband snatcher and a home wrecker.Abraham shame on you,you are toxic."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart just sank for Ceera this Abraham guy is simply a narcissist full stop!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The toxicity, selfishness, and naivety going on here💀"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No man can love 2 women.. And no man can follow two ways.. He will lose one and follow the other. there's no love here.. Cera she's deeply hearts and she has not recovered.. they are just talking nicely in from of the cameras
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you have a golden heart…..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is Abrahams legit wife, the other lady is an intruder"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So after Abraham and Maureen have been together the whole day doing all that is permitted of husband and wife, Cera gets the left-overs. I can’t imagine! Sometimes when I think of Cera, I feel like I’m the outsider who cried louder than the bereaved. …. Let me mind my own business. May be it’s not that deep for them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why draw conclusions
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is like jacob
q4sWUJxjc4g,Akuku Danger legacy lives on.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How can you love 2 dumb women at 1 time? In judgement you pervert you will stand,just a sick bastard"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He was drawn to them because they’re light skinned and wearing heels! What a shallow man. Disgusting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Three adults who are sane made their choice, irrespective of your culture, spirituality, religion so whatever makes them happy, let them be."
q4sWUJxjc4g,only time will tell.Cerah you are a God s appointed wife coz u r the first one.The bible says no one should put asunder where two are United and became one till death.Women and young girls  usikubali kuwa hiyo kifo..pray God to give you your loving and caring partner according to his reaches in glory and you will be happy forever.God is a organised and justified God..love is never shared.huwezi gawa mapenzi .Cerah keep on praying and fasting for God to give you inner happiness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is definitely NOT happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,This a clear case of a woman who has low self value and a narcissist
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapo umeongea mkuu
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a foolish man as well if this is your reasoning. Shame
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They're happy for now but in future boy child you will cry,God didn't made a mistake of giving Adam eve alone.i see danger when the kids grow up and when they will reach  their time to marry."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mister: A christian as you say.. Stop spreading immorality in the land. You say you are a christisn, but look to God's words  for instructions for your life and family. You are not following His words as written in the bible. Genesis 2:24 says.. a man will leave his father and mother and cling to his wife. Not his wives. Marriage  instituted by God is to be with one woman. Mot 2 or more.What does the 7th commandment say? Do not commit adultery, it includes fornication. It is not God's will for us to have more than one wife or husband. It will bring many problems in the family. Do not only present the beautiful side to your life with y0ur wives, living ubder one roof. Present the negstive side as well. You cannot love two women at the same time, either you will love one and hate the other. You are teaching rebellion against God. Fear God and give glory to him. It seem that all that matters to you is that you please yourself and are happy. May God bless poor Sarah , who is trying to accept, what you want to make you happy and shoowig love to the seclnd wife.Take a good look at Sarah. Cant you see she is not happy  , even though she is quiet? Poor lady. She is getting left behind in your love for your gushing new beautiful wife. Sarah. Leave that man and his new wife and make a new life for yourself and kids, in which you are happy with your kids. How many more beautiful, fair wives will he bring to live with you? It seem as if he finds it hard to resist fair women. Man shake up your follow ground and stop deceiving yourself and the poor wonen. You are not a man to be trusted you cant be faithful to one wife, how will you be faithful to 2? Hopefully, they are not the ones working to care for you and the kids that you gave them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uuuiii I hard how serah here in her heart Soo painful my God heal ur heart waaah coz for sure hiyo nikuchukiwa kabisa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Your life is like an open book, and yet she is forbidden to access your phone, Hypocrisy!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Grace wachera and nor Serah Abraham you spoilt my cousins mariage Milly and now you are here bragging ati you are the first wife. Shonoka!!  Abraham had a child with Milly and you know that very well. she is a big girl now almost 12 years of age.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I choose not to judge but just this is running in my mind the man is simply selfish! what makes him not to marry, no.3,4,5,6 or even surpass Akuku Danger? I stick with the bible on marriage!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you knew he is married! stop lying! but feeling ni feeling tu, you fell in love with married man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is  a womanizer!! he doesn't even deserve both of you.If i were the first wife i would leave immediatiately.UPUZ!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks  God alikupe bby gal what goes around .........
q4sWUJxjc4g,facial expressions tells it all you can tell that Cerah is just there because it happened. am raising a gal and i will not advise here to go this route.hata kama ni second wife kila mtu akuwe na her own space asiiiiiiiiiii.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After Maureen found out that Abraham was married, she could have left..they are millions of men out there. But she went ahead and got pg so as not to loose him, let her stop pretending being an Angel, she made serahs heart breed but Serah choose to stay for her kids...Abraham was ready to let her go so I doubt if he still loves Serah.
One day Serah will open her eyes and cut out the pretence.
Anyway these are rich people's problem coz if Abraham was poor/not well off doubt if this Maureen could even be interested in him  and if Serah would stay"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No this is not God's doing!!!! Sir you're not a follower of Christ. Repent and believe the gospel. Maureen repent and leave that couple alone.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen please look for your husband. Have some respect. But I know this selfish man will go out there and look for another one. Poor Sarah.😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This  is African culture, if people are honest and open like this then there is no shame for people that decide to have polygamy as a relationship , we are not the only culture that practises life this way, the Bible presents a new guideline in the new covenant and everyone can make decisions based on this, in the old testament there was no limit to how many wives one could have, there also has to be historical/cultural and moral context to this. We are not talking of men just being promiscuous but choosing 2 wives and having the unique lifestyle , im impressed with the level of maturity shown here and it can actually work . I am glad this set has merged and it will be healthy because of transparency ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Shortage of men is real aki. I think this guy will still go for a number 3.Cerah, friends do not share husbands,I think you found yourself between a rock and hard place."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter what,how good ceral is they must have separated houses. Am a moslem and have seen this before, but separate houses"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man doesn't love ceara anymore he fully replaced her with mourine he doesn't have respect on Ceara he will definitely do it to mourine his a prick he doesn't talk about love more about ceara, woman must liberate each others u took ceara 's man becouse her man lost interest on her u agree to be the second wife to cover up r self so ceara is not hurt that's bullshit find your own man mourine u shouldn't have a child with this man his control from the way he talks"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Another thing that society likes to hide is the fact that polygamy is actually harmful to women's reproductive health. Women in polygamous are always treating  bacterial vaginosis(BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) because they keep on passing it on to each other. All women have different vaginal pH and as long as they share the same stick they'll keep distorting the ph and  will always have these infections. This Abraham guy is the only winner here while these ladies have to share a man, live in a limited space and have smelly itchy pussies due to infections."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is very true, I met a man with two wives, the 2nd wife is in and out of hospital because of a womb issue and can't bear him any more children, so he was proposing I become a third wife to give him kids. He's mad!lol"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmmmm unacceptable just because u got pregnant and the guy didn't want to leave u cos of pregnancy u broke cera marriage pls  She's not happy nowonder she calls u friend 🤣 perfidious man💔💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcisst only changes the supply if u know u know
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham: I see a sarah and a Hagar. However Hagar's son was not a product of sexual infidelity, for the biblical Abraham had discussed it with Sarah beforehand."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Madness at its best
q4sWUJxjc4g,What exactly am I watching? Alah!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not advocating for this nonsense.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"👂👂 This man ABRAHAM
Nooooooo please Thank
Call Me a fool but I’ll never fight for  a marriage or relationship as people say 🚮🚮 I can’t"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah loves her husband soo much,respects him and she wont lose him for anything like they've come from far and his husband loves her too  but he was ready to lose her if she didnt agree in his terms coz for his new lover.Anyway she might look fine but it hurts sharing a man that you thought you would grow old together just the 2 of you but BOOM!! 3rd wheel..knowing ur man loves another oooh damn it!! FOR ME I CANT  i'll die slowly i swear"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are being shared as simple as that!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There are two things too wonderful for me, three that I cannot understand: how cheating can be normalized; how low one can stoop for a man; how ‘Victoria’ can rise to the occasion with the full knowledge that ‘Victor’ is in use elsewhere"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hahaha imagine...how do you sleep with a man knowing he was with anther woman the previous night  the 🚮  🚮 🚮  self worth and self esteem ni kitu ya maana sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your second wife was meant for someone else that's not God's plan
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People should stop criticizing and mind their business.No one is perfect we all have our wickedness in one way or another.
I'm happy for them and God bless them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,wooie this gal serah she is still in pain gal its well be strong mama
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is nothing genuine about this ""love/ marriage"" thing in fact the whole story irritates me, the fact that Cera had to find about this her own way leaves a lot of questions unanswered: what if she had not seen the photo, what if she had not asked Abraham about the relationship, would he have come out clean? Waah! this betrayal of the highest order."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not funny
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cant watch this nonsense to the end. Before marriage and kids all women should go for therapy from a professional so that you can identify your weak spots and work on your self esteem so that you can avoid this kind of nonsense in future and you can avoid exploitation from greedy, selfish narcissistic men in future.  Anyway ladies if polygamy is a must ,never be the first wife!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will go outside marriage again... So sad 😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But Serah u deserve better darling..... this is a "" boy"" u deserve a man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly speaking these women agreed to stay together just because of the hubby. Trust me if a man had to die first(God forbide) they definitely will go there separate ways
Speaking from experience -my elder brother was in such a marriage (situation) and his wives separated 2 months after the death of my brother,they used to be good friends sisters but ryt now they are enemies"
q4sWUJxjc4g,""" I didn't want to lose her"" jst turned me off .... Wabula agasajja .... 🚮🚮🚮🚮"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen and Abraham are very selfish . This won't end well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Somebody invaded cera's peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is crazy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Okay, since everything happened from the beginning may God help them to keep the same spirit till end. I can't judge them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is so beautiful but i know she has alot of pain in her as a woman i hope she heals and leaves
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The children will face stigma,they will never be able to understand ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy should be a dictator 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Have you realized this guy is always frozen and shocked.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is narcissistic! He's failed 😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please God . I don't need a Maureen in my life . Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please  Sallah don't  cover up this bustard Abraham. he doesn't  care  about  evern  himself.  I really hate  you Abraham and this second beach so called Maureen. Salkah I salute  you Babe.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This video showed up in my feed and I was immediately taken aback by the title. I am not one to look at an hour long interview especially with such a title as it doesn't align with my faith and culture, however,  5 minutes into the video I was very much impressed with with the interview. You have asked every question I would have liked to have an answer to. Your calm confidence and your respect for the family is what caught my attention. The wives are beautiful but I will not comment further on this as I would want to respect their choice as much as I would like to be respected if I was in the situation.  
Cheers to you Lynn on a fantastic,  professional and well put together interview."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why is
Doesn't align with your faith
Then
I respect this family in tge same sentence"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@frashiermwihaki7453 , I do not believe in Polygamy, however that doesn't mean that I don't respect this family.  I respect people as I would want to be respected.  Have a blessed day"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really hate you Abraham. I wish you are any near me, I will slap you evil face. I wish that Maureen  will one day and go and look her own life. Sallah I do pray that Lord will see you through and your kids. Abraham  same on × Trillion times."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham  you're  really  bustard.  Why did you do that to Sallah??. That right Maureen  you came to spoil  Sallah""s life. Same on yourself. Abraham you just look like a bus fool. Go to hell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have never gotten the energy to listen to this story, This man has no heart or remorseful whatever. If he's truly a hero this two women should have separate homes. 
I am praying for serah to find a better way out from this disrespectful marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hey at 24:44 this guy proves that he’s a narcissist 😡!!! How the hell does he then continue to impregnate another woman if he felt any sense of guilt at all???!!!! Cerah deserves a matured man !!! I pray she finds the courage to walk away from the psychologically disturbed man and watch both of them crumble to the ground!!!! Even Maurine is just a business transaction 😡😡!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow I guess what truly moved me about their story is the beginning of the love story between Cerah and her husband… watching with the other wife in mind I started feeling uncomfortable on her behalf… how do you sit there and listen to such an authentic love story and you know very well - all you had to do was to pack your bags and move in? 

Though I was kinda disappointed by Abraham’s response to how he knew Cerah was the one for him… it wouldn’t surprise me if he went and married #3 coz he does feel like he’s a lady’s man 🤔."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I also noticed that part when he said what made him stick to ceerah.....hiyo ni kumtumia tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is sad,it shouldn't happen to Cera this way,seems she is under manipulation,she has to do what she's told,ooh God,have Mercy on her, strengthen her and give her peace of mind"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't afford that patient akh .betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He started cheating very early.... The pain behind ceras face is too much n we all can see she is just holding it..... Abraham doesn't even care about her feelings n Maureen seems too proud to have destroyed the marriage..... No woman can stand seeing her family fall, all she s doing is being strong."
q4sWUJxjc4g,… cerah and Maureen should form a love relationship and be lesbians
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mabibi ignore pretenders, how is having a mpango common sense? Eti bora sijui na aje home? 
This is a beautiful family, my God protect them and bond them and their kids. Ameen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is so swt n humble, Maureen is loud, a home wrecker no better name for her. Abraham is lustful 🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to Serah!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why did they not wait to consult Sarah first before they even had the kid....she talks like she is concerned but she did Sarah wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nie ndingehota..weuh..kwani Adam alitolewa how many ribs Lynn??
q4sWUJxjc4g,The authenticity of all this will be tested with time. This man will one day be left sole. Cera chose number 1.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I finally gained courage to watch this 😭😭😭😭😭😥 weeeeeeuh Cerah and Amira same wozzaap group!!Both pains are so VISIBLE!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amira was just chilling 😎 🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata mi nimekaa hadi leo ndio nimewatch haki this guy ananiboo
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's okey because she has to😭Maurine has a pretty heart but she looks like she can change soon.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My grandma used to hug her co wives when they drove home from town but my grandpa lost his wealth on his young wives n came home barehands ....men invest in your 1st wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn fornication is so sweet but it hurts alot to the person in the picture like Cerah actually i feel goosebumps n 💔💔💔i fear such things...Cerah is still young and beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uyu mubaba bado atacheat tu na alete wa tatu mkiwa apo tu happy this man though 🤦‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a big hypocrite. This is just praising adultery. He will still continue cheating.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really feel for Sarah, this man doesn't love her anymore.She is there to take care of the kids.How can this man tell Sarah directly that I love Maureen so much, while Sarah was expectant 😥? Pole sana Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's very convenient how Christians quote the bible only  when it suits them. Most of you entered your marriages while fornicating, yet the bible condemns that. Why not address that first. Remember, 'he who is without sin,'......Secondly, some of you your husbands have 'side chicks' not one, several, and you are not aware of and yet you want to judge this brave man for being open with his situation.  He's happy and that's all that matters. He's not asking for charity to support them. Lynn thank you so much for creating awareness ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"NAAAAAAA,I 😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men will always be men, truth be told the gentleman cheated on his dear wife, no doubt about it. Second wife its fine with her coz shes on an advantaged side period. First wife is not fine everything going on in the marriage only bcz she has 3 children, that makes her insecure."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Disgusting!! Period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Anyone who has noticed Maureen was ready to mess this family up by keeping ceras phone number according to what she has said .
Cera is going through alot of pain and it's showing outrightly on her face any body movements"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Such a stupid man!!!you wanted to loose her but she didn't leave.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May be two women but not in the same house, God have Mercy....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes now they seem ok but how was cerah feeling after having a baby and the man is chasing someone else the pain this first wife went through is too much sending her love and hugs 🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't understand this Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly when this episode came out I didn't even click on it. Today I decided to give it a chance but nooooo🤦‍♀️ this guy apana.. He has an answer for every thing but most of it is a lot of English that doesn't make sense. Eg, his response to Lynn's question of ""can you love 2 ppl at the same time."" He's giving narcissistic characteristics."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He wasn't going to say her loves one more or it will cause issues. The same way you can't admit who your favorite child is even though the whole village knows. Doesn't mean you are a narcissist 🤸🏼‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah has a good heart and deserve a big prize. the Man as well who convince and make Cerah to understand the hole situation. Maureen have to respect Cerah very much instead. keep praying because many people will not happy to see such family  happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,A true Narcissist. Loves the attention this situation brings. May be on his way to chase a Showmax deal like the South African Polygamy family....The Mseleku family.  Really sad for Cera but the Universe will take care of things.. as usual
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is another Samido and Karen story. just because someone is giving you business or connections, they come and take over your life. wives have no choice in such situations. the second tells you 'I made you who you are'. FULLSTOP!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham I salute u!U hv proven to be that truthfully man b blessed always & forever.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As for me,let me persevere loneliness and single life than having to put up with some kind of lives in the name of love. You see his first defense mechanism was so you went through my phone,,,red flag. For me if i am dating you,i am into all your businesses trust me. Men use that thing of don't go through my phone,same case i will not with yours just to have cheating platform because if Serah was free with the phone,she could have known it from beginning.  Imagine having to deal with such kind of emotions with the person you love and upon confrontation he is like whatever the case,i am not pulling away my support bla bla bla...so he defended Maureen first meaning he loves her the most. He did not even care about hugging Serah and assuring her of his love towards her...i am tired of writing because it's hard to understand what really men want in our lives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is white washed happiness.Abraham,you are a monster.you have taken advantage of these women's Naivety"
q4sWUJxjc4g,dem you hagai may what you think youve done right be done unto your daughter thats when you will realize dat what you did had sharp cuts unto cerahs life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a no no.....this will destroy Sarah's life and its not worth it
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I didn't hear him mentioning loving his first wife
When asked on wether he takes them out individually ametaja Maureen cos of work so that's means the dates are for the second
Plus the first wife has to jiongeaa.....man that's not cool 🤦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"' I did not want to loose Maureen' ....but was not very afraid of loosing Cerah! This man is Selfish, he is arrogant, he is toxic! I hope Cerah will find the strength to leave this shitty relationship!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its so evident Abraham loves Maureen so much, he defends her n would not want to.loose her so serah had to comply"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i disagree,he married cerah for 8yrs,but cheated on her ,i am so sure deep deep inside cerah suffered,the guy cheated for some years and finally pushed her accept a co-wife..this is fake lyn,my dad married a second wife  and life has never been the same...the guy above anakaa kufinyilia,wait until he marry the 3rd wife."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One have to set boundaries from the start of the relationship and be principled about them. Polygamous is a No for me in a relationship.
One has to wonder what if roles were reversed and one of this woman fell in love with two men and moved both of them in one house? 🤔."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn…We shall re-visit…In about 3-5 years😁😁…Two women CANNOT live in the same house together!!…Let Abraham aoene vile atanunulia each “wife “ their own place for the sake of peace and privacy….Weuh!!😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Any man that tells  woman with young children that you can leave but you will leave my children is manipulative and controlling. A  mother can never leave her children hence continues in an abusive marriage. We are supposed to believe he is such a good man, that he loves his children. Rubbish. By reading between the lines,
I think Abraham's family see Cera as the main and don't really acknowledge Maureen and rightly so. Young ladies, your own money ni lazima. Let Cera teach you that! Cera we are all rooting for you. Inshallah, God will bring a solution that is perfect for you and know your story is not in vain. You have been used to teach many young women a life lesson. Maureen and Abraham your fate awaits! Malipo ni hapa hapa.

For me, the part that hit the hardest was that time Abraham and Cera were in the car and she confronted him and he told her mimi nampenda na sitomwacha. He! Cera just know you're the anointed one because for many women hiyo gari ingegaragara. He! Ati what? 
This man loves Maureen. You both need to release Cera and Cera kubali, usishindane. Walk away love.
Think about your children and in this internet world how much ridicule will they face growing up? What example are you setting for them. Would you be happy if your daughter ended up in this kind if shambolic relationship?
Na macome we stay jamani tuziwache. Na wakikuyu jamani, ndoa tunapanga miaka na miaka?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is total madness..Sera be careful
q4sWUJxjc4g,God you guys
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes out to Serah. She is still going through the pain of rejection. She keeps taking deep sighs.
Also @Lynn Ngugi, 1½ years is not enough time to confirm this arrangement as 'happy'. 
Also, the guy looks at Maureen more.
Anyway, this is not convincing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm thinking 🤔 too
q4sWUJxjc4g,yeah time will tell even abraham confirmed it isnt easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,U have spoke my mind
q4sWUJxjc4g,The interview left me saaad😭😭😭😭ni hayo tu kwa sasa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham be  grateful u chose yo targets well, both are very docile atleast for now.classic narcissistic man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My question  is if yo so remorseful why didn't she reach out to Cerah ,  ahaaaa this seems so unbelievable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is it just me or Maureen doesn't come off as authentic like her guilt is fake. No real  remorse whatsoever. Now we all know why Joseph in the bible fled,when God says run , run Maureen is proof"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To all of you who are judging Moureen, shame on you. I honestly feel happy watching this and to some extent I've wished that if one day my hubby will have another side lady, he may emulate Abraham's story. Well done Lynn in bringing out this story, from now henceforth I'm a true fan. For Mourine and Cera, plz continue being you and don't let these selfish people's words destroy the happiness in this family. I love you both and know that what God has joined no man can separate"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but no one is entitled to ignorance. This is such a Gullible reasoning.smh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jeez I thought love is jealous
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueeeeh...tough one. But for some advice, as you guys grow older, build separate homes. It may be good now, but as the family grows, things may get tough. when Abraham visits each home, let each person own him personally. It has happened, God will give you grace. But for single young men, fall in love first. Mingle and choose your perfect of them all and then settle down. I feel that the guy fell in love after settling down, but with a different woman. You are responsible and took the challenge to be a dad, and husband to both women who fell in love with you. It's better than hurting, abusing, and fighting one due to frustrations. No one is perfect. To cerrah, you loved Abraham. him leaving you after finding Maureen could hurt you. The choice is yours. But if you have decided to love him even after he finds love again, its okay. May God give you all your portions of Grace. #Peace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This only happens to the rich get broke ad understand what life means
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is he in Forbes?
q4sWUJxjc4g,1st and foremost never underestimate a silent woman. Abraham will definitely get a 3rd wife and Maureen shall be hurt properly na cera atakuwa ana smile
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As for me this is a no...God said ask and it shall be given unto you and trust in God...am not a perfect wife but I keep trusting good every day to always make me a good wife and my husband a good husband....I trust God that even if this are dark times where adultery is everywhere that my husband will never love someone else nor marry nor have an affair,may my womb be the only womb will carry his offsprings,and may we live long and blessed...God is able to add even men in this world aki nothing is impossible with God,wacha tukae na utakatifu na tumwamini...every wife take it to God in prayer that this women out here who don't care if a man is married or not they have no portion in your marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Player ni player tu.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is cera adoration contributed by background she comes from as is their family well up?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is so beautiful. My questions goes to Abraham what picture is he creating to his kids in the future. God created Adam and Eve not Adam and Eve and Eve. Waaaah this story may God help us.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah did you ever feel to leave your husband or your marriage and at what point did you choose to stay. Cerah you such a strong woman to endure all that. Mapenzi WEWE. May God help you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham will not end with 2 wives he marry other more
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The more i watch this video the more I see how selfish this man and Maureen are, aint no way a woman feels content staying where there's a goat wife. 

Honestly, avoid dating men who haven't explored."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly as a psychologist; the first wife looks a bit uncomfortable ( look at her facial expression, how she looks at the second wife and the husband too ) while the second wife seems content and happy ( you can tell by how she is smiling and looking at the first wife when a question is asked or when the man is speaking ) ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are stupid to let him think, he is a king or something. God won't be happy with that.  That's bigamy  if he's married to both legally"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah just accepted because she love her husband....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have been avoiding this interview ever since I saw it and my fears have been confirmed.Serah is being shortchanged.That man only loves Maureen.
Na pia ako na pride sana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes for cera i will never wish for anything like this to happen to someone.
Is to painful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY ❤ I BELIEVE IN LIVING A GODLY WAY OF A MAN SHOULD HAVE ONE WIFE🙏🏾 BUT IF I WAS SERAH I WOULD DO WHAT SHE DID ACCEPTING THE SECOND WIFE BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT CHANGE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH THE HUSBAND AND THE SECOND WIFE.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy likes Maureen more than Cerah it's clear. Is it because she's the second or? Cerah she's still young and so mature she can move on or cheat also with a fine man if she's willing to stay😂 cause aiiih me I can't! Wuiiiih
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This 1.5 yrs married living in one home is an infatuation no possible way to tell the level of pure happiness..it is too fresh. The 2 women humble like little kittens but inside of them they carry so so much and overall this is just acceptance because they all want a piece of him, period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are studying one another. Lets wait who'll finally turn the back against another one!

People like Serah are sometimes dangerous. They take serious decisions in silence. Lets wait and see"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kittens 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is nothing to have. He looks as if he owns them..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very unfaithful, selfish, and ungodly of this man, so sorry for Serah, you have tolerated so much."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is pure deceit! Hakuna raha hapo, truth be told!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woi ma cerah your facial expressions speaks your pain
Your deep breath says you ain't happy
Stop faking it
You need more than what money can buy
Live for you not for Abraham
Your guy loves Maureen more she's his soul mate you with them coz it happened 
You need better 
Friends my foot.thia ain't your friend Abraham akasota mtajya Maureen ni nani"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ile pain niko nayo kama sio Mungu. 😭😭Wangu get married another woman and keep her in my house. And that lady nikunitusi. The bad thing is my husband ananisema kwake mpaka kwa house maid. And he still tell me that he loves me but never apologize for me,what he said it's was my fault and I didn't see what did I do to deserve that. It's him every time nikuhanya. Mungu ako na anaona 😭😭.And you thenya you shall never find peace coz you left your children and your marriage and come to destroy my house and my children happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera why don't you also bring a second husband in that house and see how you will be chased away... Girl don't allow people to treat you like trash.. you are a queen and you should raise your standards to the highest plane don't allow anyone to step down on you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So now we are here glorifying adultery? Anyway I guess it’s better than kulala lala nje. Other than that nothing striking about this man
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy zii
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lets not lie to one another, Cerah is so heartbroken and this maureen is guilty. Not human at all and there is no love here. Mpango wa kando will remain mpango wa kando. Think twice Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"BODY LANGUAGE. Serah is suffering from first wife syndrome of imperfection, can't understand why her man wants more, she gave in all. Maureen is attention seeking, self proclaimed puchritudinous syndrome always caught out with questions because she's still processing what others just said about her. Kinuthia thinks he's settled coz he put the missing puzzles together. After sometime their bodies give in, they gang against him, he will be chasing some 19yr old slayer who wants wild fun, No.3. and that's what he's been missing all his life"
q4sWUJxjc4g,On God🥺I dont have Sera's heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story is sickening
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Whoever has specialised in psycholgy  plus Theology like me will totally agree that Serah needs help, she is not herself. No woman will claim to be okay in a polygamous setting for the first wife Cerah its a life time torment"
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Whoever come between 2is death it's word from the author of marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is in pain and she has inner fear of so many things
Maureen is ok because the guy openly shows love 
May God guide serah praying for her 
Unfortunately the man is so full of himself and ego is all over 
More Grace to serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No,Serah is hurt...we can't hide that. This is  a no to me.she has not healed up yet."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeh ...Cerah is such a strong woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is selfish. Serah has not come to terms with this. Ts a time bomb.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is more beautiful than Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have seen this story in 3 different media channels now and my heart breaks everytime I look at Cerah 😢 May God help us ladies
Abraham please don't justify what you did with the men of old of the Bible... we are in a new covenant now"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I salute de man he is open  most  men out there have over five side chics but it's  ok
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is even fumbling when asked the real question she is now realizing that what she did was shameful, but is not shameful to be in a threesome kind of relationship. This story is shameful and gross!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All i am seeing is a selfish man, an abused woman( Sera) and anapologetic home wrecker ( Maureen) . This is total madness and should not be condoned! These people will one day kill each other!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Never 🙄🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,I support you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera you are beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nie ma!So what are these?No amount of sanitation will make this even sane Gai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let the truth be told!! Serah is hurting inside her, but who Am I to judge??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera , this is so painful, this guy doesn't love you,anapenda homewrecker"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you are such a good interviewer. You have done justice to this interview.  No glossing over issues, but yet maintaining tact."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dr
q4sWUJxjc4g,I do not believe that Sarah is happy with all this. She just afraid to lose him to the other woman  .Am sorry Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If the other woman (don't even want to say her name because she makes my p*ss boil) cared about SARAH, she should have left her husband well alone! The lying through their teeth is sickening. Sorry Sarah, may God guide you and your kids. The husband wants his cake and then some - his BS is astonishing 🤥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii comment section you'd think everyone is from a monogamous family. Some of you your father's have multiple wives, while others are dating married men and you're here crucifying others! The hypocrisy 😂😂😂."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a cheater. Actually he's just faking love for Sarah and this second wife is just a death in this marriage even the Bible says that. I'm  not happy about this second wife. Why did she get into Sarah's marriage? Out ni inje atoke katafute mume wake. Kwa nini alikubali kuolewa na Abraham na alikuwa ashaamwambia ana mke na watoto?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Lynn Your job is not easy but you handle it so well. I have loved it. I have heard all sorts of things said about the three, and I choose not to judge. My honest opinion is that this is way better than  those who choose to hide, if you can handle it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men wil embarraz you 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's great that this man is able to raise his kids from the two wives.. some men out here don't want to take responsibility of even one kid.. he deserves appreciation for keeping the family together 👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,💪💪💪💞💞💞💞
q4sWUJxjc4g,He can do this is separate home then he would receive the honors
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera she is my class mate
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you deserve better than this he will definitely bring a third wife. May God grant you the courage to ran away from that marriage and take care of your kids.You are a very beautiful woman am sure you will find someone who cherishes you ❤️.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I dont like this story at all.The first wife is just managing. It is not easy at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So much deceit,so much pain ,above all self righteousness by this Abraham is sickening. You have daughters ,would you love them to be in such situations? Sera, may God fight your battles,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For starters! there’s no way I’m sharing my kitchen with another woman 🤔 I guess that’s one the reasons why I’m single. Jokes aside! Cera I don’t know what’s going on in your mind since he introduced another woman into your life & moved her into your space! for me that’s very serious, but I choose to trust you have a plan & maybe you’ve invested a lot in this relationship that’s why you would choose to sacrifice your own happiness for now. I just hope it’s not forever & you have a plan that you’re working on. Women are very intelligent btw especially where children are involved. I hope & pray you get a man that sees you for who you truly are, you are special 🙏 
To the other woman I pray for wisdom, respect& understanding while dealing with Cera & while you’re living under her roof & I pray for you to be happy as well. 
To the man of the house, was this truly necessary?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pain is written all over Cera's face😥😥😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,She looks drained from everything
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What happens when he meets a third person? Will both ladies accept her, I don’t think so!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,it's like comedy but it is real thanks for the love
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is Abraham's favourite and she knows it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera was betrayed here, but the heart she has is very rear to find, shes so much in love with her husband to a point she can sacrifice her love for him to be happy, but no heart can love 2 women equally, its impossible."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This so called man is soo full of himself....egoistic.....i feel for Serah...she does not deserve this kind of vultures in her life....she looks sad....if she had a way she could leave...but she cant.. with 3 kids its not easy out there....and princess maureen....you knew abraham was married...wacha kutundanganya hapo hukuwa unajua....mwenye anaumia hapo tu ni Serah....its written all over her face....the sadness...the pain in her heart....but hana namna...itabidi avumilie.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the best arrangement . There are so many People pretending to have one Wife _ yet they keep other Women elsewhere in secret !! Why segregate the Kids / Wives  ? All families should come up and acknowledge they have Kids elsewhere and be responsible for them .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am sorry Cerah. Just go when you really get tired The Holy Spirit is with you and you are worth much more than this  drama can offer. You look it. Your husband is just attention seeking and very selfish. I wonder how he would act if you brought another man. Maureen please shut up.the fact that you are bulldozing your way into an established marriage you are a home racker. Sir, sit down, you sick."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is not happy, she has to pretend"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A saying goes that for as long as someone hates you,they will accuse you of spreading dust even when you are swimming. No matter how much these people try to explain some people simply won't buy it. Most are urguing from a frustrated point of view either having come from a polygamous family or divorced because of another woman. And yes my grandpa was polygamous neglected my father and his siblings but Abraham is different. You claim to love Lynn so don't bully her guests. Be strong the Abrahams!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,And He is called Abraham the father of all nation. Awuoro 😀
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oohh no i hate seeing this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What's their Instagram handles, I love their conrows"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen's nayo hukua na mood swings sana. Io part nilirelate nayo sana juu ata at times I get mad for nothing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,the way abraham says that they are both his weuuhhhhh no comment
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lawwwdd,Chile, it's giving Peter Gunz,Tara and Amina from Love and Hip Hop New York 😭😭 not good for the first wife at all,she is reducing herself and surpressing her emotions to hold on to this toxicity 💀😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1:34:00 maureen gets the assurances and all cerah gets is “and for you .... si unajua tu “   wueeh , One of the Women is not happy but is staying for her kids ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first time she confronted him about his cheating and having a kid with maureen. He gaslighted her by asking why she went through his phone
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a good man evil men are the one's who bring a Twenty20 year old girls when they are in their fifties most girls are gold diggers
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't want to say something coz I might hurt someone but for me, this is a big NO! I just can't"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why are people behaving as if polygamy is an Alien thing in African set up?
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy loves moureen more than first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is wrong. Nowadays sin is praised but rem there is reward for it.. Cera I know u are not stupid. From how she responds to questions u can understand she is hiding something. Am looking for that day u will follow ur heart. Thz man has failed u. All da best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham will definitely bring no 3. If he brought no 2 why not no 3
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah God bless you kabisa. Ingekua mm sahi tungekua tuna co parent. Maureen you were indebted to Sarah for the rest of your life. Infact you are a slave there.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't shake off the feeling that this guy will bring in a third wife very soon. He got lucky the first time, thanks to Cera,  so he will do it again. Smh."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,She stayed not because he wanted her to stay but because she wanted to stay in the marriage for whatever reason she had...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Trouble coming. Mark this comment
q4sWUJxjc4g,Introduction caught my attention 'Mother of 3 and mother of 1 🤔. One family i thought both ladies would be like mothers of 4!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah should find a lover  to complete the  equation
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Lady Maureen will reach a point and get tired.Let's give it time,she won't last,she will takeanother persons' husband again."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah,get yourself a man. Achana na huyu kiroboto"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Would he be comfortable if Sarah got pregnant by another man
q4sWUJxjc4g,What nonsense Is this? Smh God will punish you 3
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me nioshe nguo na vyombo na niskume viti aRafu what am I seeing and hearing???? I am judging so bad! Don't allow this to happen to you!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Never left a comment on a YouTube video, but I had to for this one. This has left the most horrible taste in my mouth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You will cry in your older days...when your children will take sides...a must....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cant believe what am hearing, cerah raise your ,my mum went through alot  on doing the same,becoz we were only baby girls,have never healed on what we went through, welcoming another woman in your life is like killing your on family,it will haunt your children forever, one day you will tell the public,my opinion too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham literally
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Single mothers are so bitter here. They're like ""Serah walk away, live alone and Start fucking different men like us."""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Everyone has a life story, I am so happy to have my lover back again after 8 good months of separation. I never thought we will live a happy life together again, but today, I am so glad for what   Dr agbadu spell caster did for me as he cast a reconciliation love spell for me to bring back my Ex to live together with me again. My testimony to everyone who is in the same situation as i was,should dm him if you need his help Dr agbadu universe astrology spell

https://youtube.com/channel/UC3PFEx45sVnEXpOo12u0xYA"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even in a real African setting.. two women cannot... should not be under the same roof. Each should have there own house... Cera must really be having a very low self esteem.. zero self worth that she doesnt see her value in her marriage to have allowed this level of disrespect in her own home. 
This Abraham guy feels like hes Gods gift to these Women. This will not end well.. something will give eventually."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a NO for me... Cera i know your hurting and afraid to start again... but God will give you peace of mind...
Abraham find Maureen another house n show respect...🥺🥺🥺
Abraham you cheated period..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is full of it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hopefully Cerah will see the light and leave the two to enjoy their 'happily ever after'..…
q4sWUJxjc4g,True true.....3 is a crowd
q4sWUJxjc4g,"According to Abraham's demeanor😉 , there is only one wife here. Huyo mwingine atabarikiwa kwa kuwashikilia wakienjoy marriage yao. Wacha nikondeshwe na yangu 👉✌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sorry for Ceral, and I can see how Lynn is shaking, interviewing this story"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"no no...no. this man's love is authentic. He has too much to give. god has rewarded him more than one so that he can share responsibly. this kind of love is beyond the norm. it is "" true love"", not the way you may understand it. it is love in it's authenticity. this is love beyond our modern societal understanding. don't be sorry about Sera, she is not weak at all. she was made to understand her man...😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are overimagining
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you think you love two people at the same time,drop the first one and be with the second one,bcuz if you really loved the first,you wouldn't have looked for the second one.Abraham cheated on Cerah period!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If there’s one thing that I can no longer do is determine what makes people happy because of my own conceptions of happiness. Everyone has what makes them happy and if this makes them happy, I think they’re good. We can’t keep judging people because of social norms. I actually admire how courageous they are for living their lives in their own terms."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You must be a golden hearts person! God bless you!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I conquer
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is not talking I really feel for her oo. The man is something else. The second one is very happy in the marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"subscribed, Ngai kumbe nilikua nachungulia tuu🤷. Ndani mwenye  amekalia stool yangu aamke please🤣🤣."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The lesson from this story is be sure you want to marry and make sure the other person is marrying you for the right reason. Abraham married Cerah because she was wife material i.e could cook and clean and Maureen because that’s where his heart is.                                          I have always mantained being called wife material is not a compliment is just means you are good labour for household chores and to maintain the house.He put so much effort to get Maureen and just cruises past how he ended up with Cerah.                                                         Most people see Cerah as a victim but she has made a bad situation work maybe because her kids are a priority or building a family which is admirable.She is preventing possible hostility and separating the children from their dad.
Maureen is also not a villain.Her emotions seemed sincere and at the end of the day Abraham was the married one.Maureen did not owe Cerah anything."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good analysis
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If Maureen is as emotionally intelligent as you claim, she would have more common sense to steer clear of a married man, don't you think?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My  heart goes out to Cera. Hugs 🫂 mummie. Its gonna be fine. Mungu akutoe kwa hii situation.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is Hippocras!!!!! how can a woman be happy na mwanamke mwingine amekuja kuchukua nafasi yake, Maureen atoke Kwa wenyewe akatafute mme Wake,na huyu mwanaume ache selfishness, Sarah May God heal yr heart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is hurting for sure 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the most painful interview I’ve watched this year.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really hate this character of cheating,,,,,from the Man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is sin ,the 2nd partner is husband snatcher ,,,will remain sin and wickedness........"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah will be leaving soon coz it ain't going anywhere...I wish you took the mistress elsewhere..and serah is like faking the happiness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am dumbfounded! Cerah please run. These people never respected you and I doubt if they do. I feel nauseated to be honest
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to Serah❤️she is still recovering ☺️
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes to serah and prayers
q4sWUJxjc4g,The day she will recover fully she will pack and leave. Bado ako na fears of the unknown
q4sWUJxjc4g,"why are women so negative in their comments. its their life, come on!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you are soo beautiful may God grant you the peace of mind.It seems she is not yet much happy due to how she is breathing out heavily
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cant get enough of commenting,serah wooiye,you deserve your respect.maureeen is feeling guilty wooooiye,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We luv you Maurine
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera, you're such a good and beautiful woman.youre the best,have a big heart.mungu akubariki mama, you're the best n honest.for me,moureen no!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn please keep up the good work
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At the end of the day, we are human and we have all fallen short of the Glory of God. Judgement belongs to the Lord and the Lord alone. Thank you for this presentation."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When you will have anchance to speak to Abraham please ask him for me🙏What if those ladies can fell in love with two men can they come and you stay together?
I see selfish, fear, trying to fit in🙆‍♀️Ihope no one buys this atall😳😳"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is my friend nyenyenye...nitakupigaaaa..umbwaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you look at Sera's body language she seems not comfortable but if a man decides, the wife has no option."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Akiiii men.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ama the home wrecker is using black magic on Cera? This isn't normal
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeh!!! Hii maneno😭😭😭 to me it's  huuuuge ....this guy is such a naccistic nothing justifies this kind of order it's only that he was not able to drop Cera but with a possibility I know where the heart is....angemweka na huko
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone faking even an accent yawa!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me not judge but wish the family all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The word of God will never be bent or changed to fit ones immorality. Abraham you should stop justifying yourself ati all men God used were imperfect, we are here to learn from them and not be like them. The purpose of the word of God is for teaching, instructing and rebuking. 
Maureen you are a homewrecker nomatter how you try to sugarcoat things. What God himself has joined let nothing separate only death. Nomatter how beautiful, intelligent and hard-working on the measures of the word you are dead meat why lie
Serah woman up and work on your self esteem as a woman you have allowed Abraham to know your weakness and desperation. Gather your dignity as a woman he should not be cheating under your roof."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why am I even watching this useless man hurt such an innocent soul,alafu cerah mwanaume kama uyo ni wa kuishi na yeye shuwally 😫"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Beautiful family, I enjoyed the video. Respect opens many doors in life. People will always talk ignore them, they have their own dark secrets but they focus on other people. Enjoy your journey of life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Positive comment have seen so far
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's a fake laugh they are all not in a happy relationship
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is very beautiful....I don't even know what he saw in the other woman ""moreen"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am broken for Cerah😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is packing a 12"" ... Tuambie ukweli"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera plz ,usivumilie sana you were created alone, ngai me mtu aje kwangu , I swear that day the man will regret knowing me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Now this is a legit conversation..ile ya NTV ilikuwa ya camera.....this man is a narcissist
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can Serah allow his husband to talk highly about Maureen n say thats what made her love Maureen even more.Sad sad sad Serah wake up pliz
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is juuust selfish.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's nothing good about this man!!! Cerah may God shine his face upon you mama .♥ if she didn't see the pics wangeendelea kuficha awache kujifanya. Chieth 🤮!!¡!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Seriously, Serahs words to him aki. The purest kind of love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,All men who practice polygamous are too self centered...it is all abt them ....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Despicable 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you beurifil, humble and kind you just deserve better than this😥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She looks so hurt en betrayed by this wueeee
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is demonic....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera  you are beautiful  God will  always  bless you  walk with  your shoulders  high.. First  wives are  blessed
q4sWUJxjc4g,This are the end times.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is selfish,narcissistic ,egotistic and condensending.If he truly loved and respected his 1st wife,he could have approached her first, before being immoral, unfaithful and impregnating someone else and trying to justify it. Maureen is a replica of Abraham and they deserve each other.Getting involved with a married man whose wife was pregnant at that time is disgusting.Serah's decision to remain in this love triangle is up to her.If she is genuinely happy and comfortable as she claims thats good,but she should take a step back and re- evaluate if Abraham  loves her even an inch coz all i have seen is  love for Maureen the home wrecker.Love is patient,kind,does not envy,does not boast,is not proud,does not dishonour others,is not self seeking,is not easily angered and it keeps no record of wrongs and from all this nothing describes Abraham's love towards Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Miss me with the ""give or take"" statement. Smh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So sad,,,Maureen should try to fit her feet in cera's shoe😓😭😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is said that God cannot give you another woman's husband. Just say that this is the adulterous relationship we enjoy, there's no marriage here. The children are the ones who'll have the real story to tell in years to come. What stops him from getting another 'wife' or what stops either of the women from having an affair with other people anyway? None of them has self-respect."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Once a cheater always cheater, Serah , i hope you have healed from this betrayal. Let's not entertain this guy's infidelity, he knew what he was doing and I won't be surprised if he has other unknown women he is seeing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He sounds very lazy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If this guy didnt have money,am sure non of this woman would be with him. Am sorry polygamy is not the way to go."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good question Lynn how about I love you??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Their body language says it all and his foolish words seals it for me.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God continue blessing this Family 💞 you have inspired me a lot
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What kind of man is this.... this is so heartless,I can't imagine the pain serah goes through each passing day,may God strengthen you madam serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,A man different from you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how many interviews you try to get to sanitize yourself Abraham, you're still lambistic! Cerah is a good woman and you don't deserve her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure!
q4sWUJxjc4g,At 21st century what are you showing our children can't  waste time dwellling on this nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,As a counselor am Learning N seeing alot in this story acha niende coz I don't want to speak the truth i might offend someone anyway
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i can relate…the conversation i wished to hear,,,,thanks lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera you're such a beautiful woman.i love you,and your strength mama,you're the best.in,moureen nooooo!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was just smiling  on how Lyn asks quastion..this man is a manipulator..serah is in pain walai
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mpango lazima ataenda finally you will get bored my friends.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Painful aki..cera may God visit your case. Maureen leave this family. God!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wanted to finish watching but I js can't....hugs to the first wife.   This is very traumatic
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a very greedy and immoral
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen looks like a big fat liar,yeye na Abraham wanajua ukora yao vizuri"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Bibi number 3 ,4 ,5 etc on the way
Woi this is a very sad story I feel like blowing up"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mr Abraham should get a third wife tuone how well Maureen will cope and if she will be accommodating as Seraph was.Mwizi hapendi kuibiwa......
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera, u r beautiful in and out..that guy is full of himself. He didnt respect you and brought in another woman. He doesnt deserve you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sure my dear Lynn deep down  ulikuwa unastruggle kwa  hii show
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is total madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kabisaaa...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen karma Will find you
Malipo ni papa hapa
Tutakuona pia ukilia
Home breaker
You too are a nercisist"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera, receive my hugs
This a nercisist man,ati ""i didn't want to loose her"" I feel like slapping this man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I pray that Sera has a plan, cheating while married is unacceptable, and bringing it inside the house is utter most disrespect. Abraham is an abuser might not be a physical one but an emotional one. So sorry Sera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do they cook in the same kitchen? Does Abraham have turns in performing his husbandry duties?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Definitely manipulative and emotionally abusive!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How else can he become polygamous if he didn't court another woman? There is nothing wrong with polygamy. Davi and Salomon were polygamous and Jesus talked to them, worked with them, etc."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen looks much older than serah,Maureen is a home  wrecker even if she  deny it       thousand times because she had all the capacity to say No to a married man, Maureen don't care if sarah  can walk away and be with Abraham"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well, people are really negative. Our men are polygamous. All the way from David. 

Women,no matter how you are taking this, hawa wanaishi maisha yao happily. 

All the best to this family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is not happy..You cant hurt a woman you started life with then pretend you love them all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Finally I've seen the man. I saw this story from the wives some time ago. Now I see the Abraham finally. From the very first interview I watched, I could tell Maureen is the favourite. This is unfair to Cerah. She's a mature gal, looks gentle and deserves better. As much as Cerah tries to convince herself, Abraham loves Maureen more and it's not hidden."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata wewe kama proud motha si uko na favourite child/ren wala hujali. Pia wives ni same
q4sWUJxjc4g,Walai it's evident that he loves Maureen 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is it that I love crying orr,my heart breaks when hearing this story,peace peace peace serah,tihahuthu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Tragic
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ofcourse you're a destroyer Maureen rubbish. The fact that Cera had to swallow the bitter pill and say yes to you does not make you a wife, it makes you a second woman nkt nonsense."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is so beautiful....wooi arume
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah...... eish....
q4sWUJxjc4g,goodness.....what nonsense is going on here...that guy cheated. Period. Then brought her home. Mercy!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not long from now Abraham will bring in a 3rd,4th,5th  wife etc etc .... He's a big time flirt.. I can't continue to watch this.. Serah on the other hand is naive and doesn't know her self worth... Best of luck guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not being honest to herself but let's give time time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is so beautiful, so gentle, so perfect. She deserves a mature, loyal and faithful man who will cherish her and treat her like the queen she is. A man who will not make her feel like she wasn't enough for him. Wonderful men are out here."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,Plus She's Still hurting.Her body language says so
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man also took advantage of ceras kindness. I hope she opens her eyes and sees the manipulation and the narcissistic nature of this Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯 true!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just hope one day Cera gets the guts to leave,,,shes being shown in her face that shes not enough,,the immoralitt she has to cope up with is too much,,the pain in her eyes,,i can see it,,i can feel it,,if its finances may God open up a way for her so that she doesnt stays in pain coz of lack of money,,am with u in this hun,,to the home wrecker,,ur days are numbered in that house"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This episode is so cringeworthy...eiiish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I prefer my husband to have his side chick out there but bringing her in as a second wife Will be a disaster, Sera, Abraham and moreens case will not end well"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She was eager to see Maureen because he speaks so highly about her. 😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Because she felt like she had something she didn't have.That's why maureen said serah looked at her up and down when they first met
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah will need therapy for years to recover from this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hearing  this man explaining how he told his wife about Maureen. There is no love or feelings to his first wife. I didn't here him say I love you. You can see she is still struggling to accept the fact that there is another woman sharing her husband. It's like she stayed for what reasons I don't understand. Sorry I would leave if I was in Sarah's shoes 👞.
q4sWUJxjc4g,the only good thing about this guy is the jacket
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hahaha
q4sWUJxjc4g,Watching this story is simply disgusting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,By the look of things Abram loves the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All I can say I I can't,cannot,and will never entatein this madness 🤨"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu jamaa alifaa kuitwa Brayo ama Kevoh..the arrogance is on another level
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Earth is hard 😢😢,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God bless there union.....others are criticizing them, na wanaume wengi ni Wale wako na mpango ama mipango inje. So people should mind there own business."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the highest infidelity and should be condemned, just because sara is not working does not mean you should take advantage of her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hey Lynn 👋 

I have watched this family in other channels and have been left with questions. Lynn you are good at your job my questions have been answered. 

My take is Serah loves her man and wanted a present dad for her kids. She had to compromise to have him otherwise she was losing him. It seems to be working.  I wish them the best."
q4sWUJxjc4g,May the almighty God forgive this man and his girlfriend 🙏 it didn't work with the father of many nations
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sister lynn ngugi I first want to say thank you for doing this show in English I am from the US and English is my primary language . I have a question it's he married to the both of them at the same time just curious . I also practice polygyny the difference is that in the US you can only be legally married to one wife thank you again for your awesome shows God bless you always
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is married to both. However in church you can't be allowed but in African culture you can marry any number. Traditional marriage is recognized by Kenyan construction
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is it man shortage or it's the culture
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do they share bedrooms?
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that he did not tell his wife of his other child until his wife found out and confronted him…”Why did you have to ask me now?”that’s his 1st thought?  🚩. No bueno
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh 😳a NO for me!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hio coffee ya Kila Mara ilikuwa kuthinosh,so huyu Delilah after knowing akona bibi she still went ahead and spread the legs#stupiddevil"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Haki serah she is heartbroken from her looks,and she has tried to control her emotions...am not a prophet but Maureen is a devil at work"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Maireen has such a fake smile  
Unimaginable act of walking in somebody’s marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Seeing this and knowing how loyal I can be to a person,it makes me fear getting married despite the fact that I am really yearning for it....anyway I watch something like this and it drives me to work harder and be that independent woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don't be afraid. I used to feel the same then my mum told me, ""nothing is impossible to GOD"" thus day-in and day-out; keep praying for the man who will love you, respect you and treat you the same as you treat him. 

What society has not thought us is that our tongues are very powerful if we believe in what we say."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But the funny thing is that these women are already empowered and can support themselves independently..so I think they are just stuck with this man because they fear raising kids alone of they fear being labelled single...that's my view
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Naomie kosgey Makes the two of us ..
. Wacha tu nitafute pesa!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hi Naomie...are you still single?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Naomi pls there are lovely kind men out there,pray and ask God to meet one.dont give up."
q4sWUJxjc4g,HII HAPANA.OVER MY DEAD BODY
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Three personality disorder here: sera has low self esteem and pretends like everything is okay,she is the only one who lost here
Maureen;narcissistic woman who pretends to care but doesn't so that she can get her way,disgusting 
The main character Abraham the clown 🤡, narcissistic,psychopathic misogynistic,selfish person who has no one in mind but himself.
All in all,this is a circus"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How many wedding Rings he is wearing? Just wondering.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He thinks he is a 🤴 king ! Don’t even let his wife finish the story. No one his English is horrible. He thinks he is doing great ! No way. Wife did not had a choice! Whergoing to go with children. Here he let
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeehh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow,Sara is a blessed woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They make it look so nice and rosy, love is a very jealous affair, coz its matters of the heart. All i can is that we are all created so different and we all have our endurance levels. Some like cerah will accept defeat for the sake of peace, some will fight to the end. All i can say is, the day it becomes your own story ndio utajua vile uta handle."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kweli💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the comment ave been looking for....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Heeeec this is unbelievable, lets ""watch and pray """
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uyu second wife mtoto wake atafanyiwa the sem way she did to this innocent woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the only person who is selfless and has genuine love is cera hope, she find someone who will truly love her and have eyes for her only."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Talking to much
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu mwanaume ata hamake sense walai  he is hurting the 1st wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no  excuse saying that  there was no way of  turning  back coz the baby had come......you ( morine) had an option of turning away once you knee he was married.  It's soo clear  Sarah is still not happy to-date.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just from looking at Maureen face tell me she looks like a pretender n not even looking like wife material. Maureen you look older than that young couple.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Older and ugly too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your second wife looks older than you n your first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is Betrayal. I cant be in Cerah's shoes and stay. She just hasn't gotten the courage to walk away but one day, I am convinced that she will again come back here to testify how it was all a lie."
q4sWUJxjc4g,That was a good Interview..... Thumbs up Lynne
q4sWUJxjc4g,nothing is good here thanks @   lynn  ngugi  for your right questions my heart bleeds for cerah may GOD grace be with you .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its Lynn's,"" wòii nimebaki pekee yangu""😂😂 for me.


God bless this family for staying true to themselves,honesty is the best policy.Well nobody's perfect and no one is allowed to judge one another!
♥️♥️♥️."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When a man allows another woman in his life despite having a wife , definitely she doesn't love her wife.....the same goes for a woman.
When you love someone you stick to them.
Kuna mambo haisemwi hapa....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Laughter can conceal a heavy heart, but when the laughter ends, the grief remains."
q4sWUJxjc4g,So true!

q4sWUJxjc4g,What is this now....its soo hurt breaking to hear this guy talking like this....its calm before an explosion 💥....gosh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Over my dead body I'm not sharing my man 😭😢💙💛👊
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham says he has a weakness for light skin.... Serah is clearly chocolate...
q4sWUJxjc4g,The disrespect to Cera in such a public forum 🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,THIS MAN NEVER LOVED SERAH !!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,am trying to be in Serah's shoes... I  really cant
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Trying so hard to sanitize This Maureen and she is very happy about it but remember God ni yule Mzee

q4sWUJxjc4g,What kind of nonsense is this????🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is fantastic IOVE the family in Kenya there is no man who as 1 hubby is that we hide but that why we waste money ,, these r open and they r reach"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah as long as you are happy am happy for you and when you done with all this imma still be happy for you 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,this whole thing is so annoying. I think this guy has another light skinned woman somewhere. plus he clearly didn't love cerah eeeeeeish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometime you just stay because of kids they need their daddy wah can't comment more because this one is not biblical at all. Eisssh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A like this couple why it polygamy why a come from three grand mother were polygamy   it was African Kikuyu way of live before Christian eroupean destroyed it   and introduced bible  theories and stole when they colonized African and abused it . Keep it up and involve Kikuyu traditional of goat of kiama and mihiriga,or clan and dowery , aconclude return to ancient Kikuyu wedding ritualistic customary and don't allow  Christian ritual which were not Kikuyu  own both are your properties .aconclude ancient kikuyu beliefs of they are AiRu(AKa) wives one family's one mudurume (husband) build men and women principal like  ancient Egyptian north of queen and king and always walk behind them to protect them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,One wife one man Abraham you broke the trust
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He loves Maureen … and his children only.., great nonsense !!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham the Legend.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am drained with this story ,oooooh God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this family.  Lynn I have kids with a married man bt najua he will never wish me to meet his wife.  The wife is my name sake na sina ubaya I always wish the best for them.  Life continues na life is all about acceptance.
q4sWUJxjc4g,sadly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah did that out of desperation...if Maureen was that good as she claims to be she should be in her own house...she has already done enough
q4sWUJxjc4g,"....

I salute you, Lynn.  You remind me of Oprah~~"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its even a shame mentioning God in such a wicked setup ! God can never be mocked...everything seems good in the eyes of a mortal man ,,but God is looking at wickedness ...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,If I was this 1st wife I would have quit and asked for my share of our investments + sell the house!  and started a new life  What a selfish 2nd wife 🤔 moving in shamelessly  into  another  woman house.?😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagin!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, This is not Godly at all. We should be careful not to compromise the Word of God in order to please people.  Sin is sin. Let us know what the truth of the Word of God says in order to avoid being deceived. I pray that God opens your eyes to His truth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can't watch anymore of this, it's depressing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,His first wife need to move on with her life and leave the two of them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is so selfish,the only one he think about is himself."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone should get me Serah's digits... She's so so adorable and made from another material
q4sWUJxjc4g,Another material 🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aaaw;  Lynn, you are the best!! truly enjoying this episode; but am saddened for Serah; she is still hurting and he in my opinion,  loves Maureen more.  Maureen knew deep down inside that he had a family....a woman's intuition!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how much people try to give their comments,somethings are just God's doing.We as human beings are very judgemental  & self-righteous but at the end of it all His will is above our own and it must prevail.Good luck to the Abraham's and may the good Lord preserve you and do wonders in your lives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is about Abraham. His happiness. His satisfaction. It's pure selfishness. Like he said, ""Abraham's empire"". It's all about him and what he needs."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just exactly! He is a magnified form of male chauvinism
q4sWUJxjc4g,True...haki simpendi ni self-centred kabsaa

q4sWUJxjc4g,what's wrong with some men Sarah is far beautiful than maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let's read the bible now.  Genesis 2:21-25 about creation. Adam and Eve. In the new testament. Mathew 19: 4-10, then 18. What did Jesus say.  The book of Micah say. Women have filled the altar of God with tears. Why?  men have left women of their youth. The cry has reached heaven. What next judgment!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know if they say they are happy who are we to dispute.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know if they say they are happy who are we to dispute.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Things said in the Bible, comes to pass! These 2 ladies should be ready for a 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Co-wives🤔.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Bible story..na bado Abraham ako in the mission..""waiting for the part 3 of this""#lyn."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No human can love two people in equal measure. Cera is too accommodative  and it's hurting to watch her e ok with this arrangement. The second wife came when she had no way out. Abraham please give this lady her life away from Maureen. You and Maureen can go ahead and live your love and Cera can gather her love for her kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nawapenda wote
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how you're aproud,praising and sugarcoating asin.asin will remain Asin and it can easily drag you to hell .God never created two wives from Adam's rib."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"In polygamy, men end up 💔 even as they break others."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah! You are beautiful! Natural beauty! To allow a man to disrespect you by bringing another woman into my house is a no no no! To interfere with my space! My peace of mind! My children!Not even if it's Obama we are sharing! Is a no no! Just forget!!! A man of two women is a man of several affairs. Sasa the two of you in one house, he will go for an affair and several others. Don't kid yourselves. The man  will be shocked at the end of it all if he is able to come out unscathed. Jealous cannot be sugarcoated for long. Take that to the bank."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But later you new he is married
q4sWUJxjc4g,A very selfish man🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,I m like SARA are u normal?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ah this Maureen should Ve stopt when she found out he is married she was selfish, I feel sorry for Sara she deserves an acolade"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Somethings are hard. I am not sure if I can share a man. Hugs sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huge risk on all the parties
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't think I can handle this as sera... personally I would walk out but for them if they are happy then I wish them well
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don’t want to judge them but it always the guy who benefits that kind of relationship because the ladies have to compte to make him happy the guy doesn’t have do to anything. When he doesn’t get the attention he wants from them the third wife will be his solution. His first wife was pregnant when he was looking for another woman that should tell you a lot about him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I actually think this family is being true to themselves. No lies, no hypocrisy! They are all so rational and i wish nothing but the best to the uniquely blessed family. I am monogamous and a christian but this is far much better than countless people out there living secret lives. Solomon is still renowned as the wisest person who ever lived and we all know he had multiple wives and concubines."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"So obviously he cheated with Maureen before even he got the courage to let cera know they were together...one think I know cera is not happy
She's trying to prove us wrong
This is impossible"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"😂😂😂wonders shall never end, the first wife has no option. But why focus yourself where you're not happy coz  you can see."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ladies, could you be calm and agree that even your 'husband' is not married to you. Possibly you are dealing with a big family than serah. 
This set up is only for guys with enough cash. Stinking rich. Not for your man.... i feel religion is overrated. We still could live with our African culture and still do better than most christians. Look at your life as a Christian, tell us what good can we tap from it? Just accept that we are Africans not italians british American or anything else."
q4sWUJxjc4g,We love your shows Lynn but we don't have to explore moral decadence at our watch.I look forward for a better show than this one.Its really humiliating watching Sera.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kweli😳, these are the last days to those who are Christian and can understand the teachings in the bible. Where did humanity go? Immorality is embraced so much nowadays. No more pride for a women. Serah  has agreed to be used like a tool. She will regret this for the rest of her life.  Be a true mentor to your daughter Even if you do iceing and decorate feces, it can never turn to be a cake. Let's be real and live life that, young generation can learn from, for God's shake."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is a maid to you guys, and she's weak in decision making, love yourself woman, that's toxic"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm sad as a woman, sharing is not easy, these days men lie forcing you to marry them while they have their wives which is not good, this man is a hypocrite and he will regret eventually, cerahs smile and humbleness is one way of imagining what karma will do, the second wife can be seen from the face how evil she's , she forced Abraham smh, to hell Mouleen, to hell, leave Cerah to be happy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you ....wow.I wish she takes this seriously
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, firstt of all you are awesome, and thank you for your Content! 

Now to my point, Genesis 2:24  says, a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.(NOT UNITE WITH HIS WIVE'S) 

So my 2 cents this Guy is expendable. feckless. good-for-nothing. impracticable and Dillutional! he cheated on his Wife! Period!  a very Bad example of a Man to be aired for normal human's to listen! What a Bad way to treat women!

He may think he is a Hero? But to many who listened and watched this episode, the real wife is still in pain! the side Chick**(who feels entittled as a second wife is a bad example of a female! NONSENSE!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,SECOND WIFE IS NOT FOR ME. ITS AGAIST THE BIBLE. ITS REALLY BAD TO BE DONE TO YOUR FELLOW WOMAN. STOP YOUR STIRIAL TALKING AND GET YOUR SELF FOR YOUR OWN HUSBAND
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is heartbreaking
q4sWUJxjc4g,So he was ready to lose serah for moreen wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And for Abraham my word for you is Malachi 2:14 - …….. It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.”"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Abraham had issues with cera that push him to maureen..later cera realised her mistake when it's too late that why somehow maybe accept maureen indirect. My opinion
q4sWUJxjc4g,Next year a day like this  niulizeni
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham seems to love Maureen more than Cerah but she is a very beautiful,mature and a strong woman.  Maureen too is a great lady"

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a case of bringing your enemy closer....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is not happy but she is wise she can't show it. One day she will move out, or one of the two will eliminate the other if they feel like they are a barrier."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham wa ma Apple, I didn't know you have two wives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a scandal! It's end time and some people don't even know whether they are men or women leave alone the law of God for marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is a narcissist! from the look of things Serah had no choice but to accept coz the guy Abraham had made it clear it was to remain like it was.
Serah is not happily married,it's crystal clear."

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a mess. I don’t like it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is great Abraham how I wish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Any woman who  has gone thro betrayal will understand  Cera’s  situation. She obviously went through hell. Most  men are naturally selfish and assumes that  the  woman  is happy comfortable  with their wickedness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You can just see in the thumbnail how Serah looks at the way Abraham smiles at the second wife. She doesn't look happy at all.

I really hope she will gain the courage to leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""People pleasing syndrome "",while suffering internally-cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kudos to you Abraham...
For Taking care of your two beautiful women
   The kids are a blessing from God and God tells us that He knew us before we were conceived in our mother's womb...so you are a great man you never ran away from that responsibility and giving your kids all equal treatment and care and that is what is supposed to be.
    If the Bible commands that if a man decides to take a second wife He should treat them all equally and you are doing exactly that.....
   I Honestly admire you ...than men out there who abandon innocent children and let them suffer"

For Father Abraham and Maureen you are both so selfish but msi worry ya dunia mtu hulipia humu humu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh.... The loyalty of a woman is tested when a man has nothing and the loyalty of a man to a woman is tested when he has money. Mwenye macho haambiwi tazama.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Why are people so much on Maureen? kwani Abraham hakujua yuko na familia?I applaud Abraham for showing up Maureen to the public...I admire cera's beauty though
q4sWUJxjc4g,Marriage certificate question.... who has the cert and can it be given to both of them sharing the same man?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah be careful about that brown lady watch your dreams and don't take them rightly be very secretive and very, very prayerful  .... don't worry read your Bible seriously wake at anytime at night and pray tell God what you want he is faithful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have watched this story and l  feel so painful 😖 to cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart bleeds for cera. This is the hardest decision a woman can make. Knowing your mans heart belongs to someone.This dude is very heartless
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very true,how do they sleep in same house? Imagine seeing your husband in another room with another woman ?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He is enjoying two wife , he look  happier than the two wife's. Challenge for me is when he go spend night with the other wife I will not sleep."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But where did he say that his heart belongs to Maureen and not Cera? These are just your jealous assumptions

The male chauvinism of this man abraham? This home wrecker of a woman? Even by a mere look she is odd I wonder those who are saying she is beautiful, well, Cera is the beauty then!  This other lady accepting to be disrespected as a wife by the man's mpango wa kando by accepting to live with her? I pity her"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is just hot! and the ladies are gorgeous!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So Cera is an Entrepreneur,
She has her own money,and you're there pushing her to move out,
Yet in your whole life you will never meet a man half as good as Abraham."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah ,you are a very beautiful woman!  In my opinion having a co wife beside you, has got nothing to do with you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like to respect  other people's decisions, but  i  have to say that, God's original design for marriage was:  one man, one wife. Even when the likes of David and Abraham  took a contrary opinion, God never approved. in addition, many problems resulted from the polygamous unions. The effects of some, are felt in the world to date."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham needs to reconsider his decision. Cerah is your wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If they are happy who am I,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have been following this story from three different YouTube channels one thing I know for sure is that cerah is not okay,,it was not her choice to share her husband"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah has to accept it.coz Ibrahim told the second wife so much  from day one ,and she was going no where and he loves her so much.as a woman let me say this kunakapain sarah felt but coz of mapenzi anavyo love abraham had to accept it.may God gave woman's grace aki. Hii nane sarah and mary we go through through Sarah's name tunapendwa but ......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham talking about Maureen more than Cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,But cerah woiye doesnt look happy. she feels cheated. coz maureen and abraham spend all this time together especially at work
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham has basically moved his mistress in, all smiles and licking his lips ferociously. He withheld information aka cheating.  Siring outside and only admitted after he got caught he never willingly went to Serah to inform her. He was not even honest with Maureen from the beginning. This guy is picking his women based on the purpose they serve in his life convenience in mhimu kwake. Huyu ata “3rd” wife ata leta. He could have put Maureen up in her own house. Many men have side chics nahuko inje si kuwaleta kwa boma. Serah does not seem happy she did not even talk much listening to the nonsense that transpired kwa hizo coffee dates zao.
Girlies need to learn fuckboi Audacity, Confusion moves, mind games and time management 101 hadi PhD level."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I won't judge this family harshly.. some of us get to know about side chicks the hard way.. At least Serah knows  they're 2.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham has just been open on an issue many men are holding in secret ! Only GOD has the right to judge in any. I wish y'all GOD''s peace .
q4sWUJxjc4g,All I can say is Serah  I understand why ud put up with this situash u already have a kid also nobody wants to loose a good man at some point after u go back to  work life will be more vibrant....😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,True definition of betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kudos Lynn, great job done . You have opened more about this fam... funny am not excited about this poly fam....key reason being it's a journey that commenced with lots of pain, betrayal, lies, adultery, neglect and secrets...until the child's photo is discovered by Cerah and that's the point whereby polygamous Journey  starts. It would sound okay...if Maureen was introduced as a co wife to be during earlier coffee dates..she agrees to be second wife, Cerah agrees to accommodate  her, she comes to live with Cerah, and she gets a baby...but hii...I feel Cerah loves Abraham...but Abraham loves Maureen. Cerah sounds so genuine and still healing... Maureen seems to hide some truths(if they are so close how comes she was mad in the morning and couldn't tell Cerah she is not helping)...but nway wish them well as a trio for the sake of the kids..."

Guys there's a level people get to and they cleanse their bitterness and just love.  It's a very positive level. I'm not saying Abraham did the best thing neither I'm I saying Cerah didn't hurt but right now all of them are in position where they know what they want and all are working to achieve their major goals.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"""I love her so much"" this man.....Sera it's never going to be easy for you still"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For Sera this is a case of if you can't beat them join them it tells alot when someone sacrifices their own happiness for the sake of someone who never had her interests at heart😢.
It all comes down to ,are you with someone for the right reasons? 
Infatuation and lust can be confused for love.. as for you Maureen time will tell🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Are u happy with this???

Am comfortable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Ngugi 👋, please watch this video and save her life before it will be late. Ogoh Cosmas from youtube titled Uganda woman cry out. Thanks"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Any man who is not satisfied by one woman - its a spiritual matter and it need's deliverance because the creator of marriage clearly states that two will become one flesh not 3, 4 , 5 etc. Connecting your soul to more than one soul it's no longer under God's covering but the darkness ( witchcraft) even though prosperity might be visible. If Sarah knew that it was going to be that way in her future marriage she wasn't going to shake when she came across pictures of Maureen... note that Satan can also prosper you aa along as you go against God's principles and laws....May Jesus Christ locate each one of you individually for true salvation."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One positive thing about Abraham is open communication. Very few men communicate or just talk what is in their mind, they believe their wives are  mind readers."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Open communication? Did he ever tell Cerah about Maureen? Abraham is just being selfish and greedy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope one day Cera gets the courage to walk out from this selfish ungrateful man...its evident I her eyes that she is still hurt 😢..hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you did a great job with the interview. As a mental health professional I was fascinated because I wanted to understand the mindsets of these 3 people and how they navigated the issues of relationships, romance and betrayal, infidelity, and cope. Abraham is not a role model. But I love their honesty in sharing. Thank you all for sharing hard issues with the public."
q4sWUJxjc4g,give us your opinion please
q4sWUJxjc4g,We request that u help us understand this triangle if u don't mind. Is it possible that he can truely equally love both of them??????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In such triangulated relationships usually one of them is a victim. 
In this case ,the victim is Serah . She takes care of everyone notice how they met with Abraham ""he asked me not to go"" and her being a people pleaser she even had to wash his house . Then Abraham loves her based off the things she did for him. He wanted someone to make his life comfortable. 
Then notice what he says about Maureen,  he loves Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah looks hurt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@margieunusual kweli kabisa I thought I was the only one who heard how Cerah and Abraham began cohabiting...he kept her because of her services around the house...hata he mentioned right in this interview.
Men like Abraham are walking around wounded and looking for love which they don't have inside of them.
I wish I could say he loves Maureen, but nop, soon his attention will be drawn somewhere else because of this insatiable void caused by his wound.
Hapa wametuficha vitu mob..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love is a choice so yes one person can love two people because he chose to love the two people. But New Covenant/New Testament does not support or encourage polygamy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women do you hear the reg flags to look for when men are lying? they pretend to be busy. They are dismissive. watch out for a cheating spouse.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see a boundary problem here as cause. Abraham needs to watch out so another women will not creep into his life. He was having problems with his wife and gave the devil an upper hand. The three people are beautiful people but here they are. We don't encourage such. Bible says every one should have one husband one wife. ofcourse they now have a supportive relationship with the wives but emotional things are complex. Cerah is human and has the right to be jealous lover or angry but she has accepted because she is a gracious woman who has accommodated her husband's greed. I pray you all the best and teach your kids right. I don't know what your children will learn from this. For me its hard. Lord have mercy on us.
q4sWUJxjc4g,When u cant fight u surrender for the sake of peace . U don't fight a soldier whose already down . And sadly honest

q4sWUJxjc4g,His good at the game 🎯
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a disgrace 💔😭😭🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Did he legally marry any of these two women? I heard about living together...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the pain in Lyn's face 😢😢😢😢😢😢,....am not judging but weuh!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From my view,Cerah doesn't look happy,truth be told"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Av watched this story 2times,without hubby and now this,but to be honest,Eeeish its complicated kinda confusion,and Lots of mixed feelings,hidden anger,selfishness and of coz,Who can understand Love? Even Biblical Solomon got confused!Niie Reke nemwo,dingihota"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what will stop this man from cheating on both wives with another woman.He already has traits of infidelity.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is so beautiful ad humble,I wl not juge bt GoD take over,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn what is this??this guy and Maureen are just disgusting,serah may God give you the grace to walk away you deserve better than this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hate this kind of betrayal by Abraham to Sarah...no Matter how good Maureen pretends to be the fact remains that she is a home wrecker....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is very beautiful she deserves better
q4sWUJxjc4g,am lost for sure;sera doesnt look okay she looks that ni kama ametengwa  the fact that Abraham and mourine are spending quality time at work  is not apprehending but who am i to judge 🤗🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Going from having business conversations over coffee to having a daughter, guys i dont understand why they both sugar coating the fact that Abraham cheated. Maureen you said to yourself apparently that you did not wanted to see Abraham again but than how come the baby after that.  Maureen please just say you knew the guy was married and you continue anyways and got pregnant and Abraham how about you say that you were selfish and disrespectful to your wife that you cheated and bear a child with your seide chick, plus i dont like it when you lick your lips"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii imenishinda kumalizia.....I just can't.
q4sWUJxjc4g,hata kwa dawa I won't
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This one......Aiiiiii,,,Mimi siwezi aki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham you really betrayed  serah...haki i feel for her...she even don't want to remember that...
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is nothing but a big JOKE! I feel sorry for those Ladies because you both are just BUSINESS to him!  whenever he comes across another lady that will benefit his business he would go after her! He is nothing but a NARCISSIST!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham can't even let Serah speak for herself; always cutting her short.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've noticed that too....n also he's talking about Maureen most of the time
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki I feel for Sarah, the love she has for Abraham is real.
May God bless you mama Pendo."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I sympathize with Sarah this guy is having his cake 🍰 and eating it and this other lady she said in previous video she knew the guy was married why deny now she in this video says she kept the wives no in case the guy acts funny Ala she didn't care about Sarah for heaven's sake with 3 children she had the right to upkeep and let them not talk of being honest and we have good housekeepers who work and know their boundaries but off course majority in Africa think they are entitled to take over home's what crap
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you are a beautiful rich woman and no matter what you say or behave you have broken  a family .Serah is beautiful but broken inside herself and all the tears she cried and continue to cry internally will haunt you and your children .What would you feel if your daughter undergoes the same route? What about you ? Right now ,many women are praying for Serah and God of faithful women will pay Serah handsomely . Abraham you will know the pain of living with two women the day your pocket will run dry. They will gang up against you .You think you are a king today but that day you will become a slave . Praying for all of you to know God in a different way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The pain of your husband being taken by another woman is imbearable I tasted it. Maureen you could have done better than than . Thank God you have a daughter if its done to her hope you will veeery happy too
q4sWUJxjc4g,This whole story is so disgusting manipulation of feelings all over
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's seems many here are into western culture of one man one woman which is not practical especially when a Man have ways and means to take care of more than one woman, all the great Men in the Bible had more than one woman and God didn't see any problem with that. This narrative brought to us by wazungus corrupted our head such that we see polygamy as a evil arrangement."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And my question is how do they be when the man goes to make love to the other I mean this whole thing makes no sense
q4sWUJxjc4g,But women how do you just go to break a home this woman Sarah is going through alot
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen stop calling her Serah..you are so annoying... Hugs dear Cerah..this guy doesn't love ..he only saying how good you are but Love...noooo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don’t be fooled serah. Abraham you are a womanizer. What if cerah had had an affair on you Abraham would you have been okay with that . Just because you are a man makes it okay?You are not a good father that you say you are because of you were you would not have been a bad example to your children ( infidelity). Because your wife has had a baby at the time and probably busy cooking cleaning laundry you felt maureen whose only responsibility was to wash her self was better ? How dare you Maureen the moment you knew he was married you shdve let go. Cerah keeep your eyes open. Cerah you settled for less here. You are a businesswoman Cerah , you shdve left him"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmmh I think I'm one of the violent ones hata kama ni mapenzi wacha ikae
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is so blinded by this guy. She is even the one who wanted to meet the side chick eagerly.  She was ready to do anything to impress or keep the man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueee I can't hold this ukisha oa Kaa mbali na mimi that's all hakuna Cha best friend hapa😢😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara/Cera is bottling in pain. A day will come when she won't be able to hold it any longer. She's all set to please the hubby setting aside her own happiness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man has a sweet tongue he will keep fooling ladies until he have a netball team
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truly speaking Cera loves her husband is hurting but being a wise wife she accepted everything to be the way it is to save her marriage. For Abraham, he actually wanted a business assistant whom he found in Morin and by letting Cera have a break in the name of baby sitting, he is trying on waters. Morin is guilty as will be and is only trying her best to fit in. Otherwise i pray for more grace of patience for Cera,  more wisdom for Abraham and long-life to all of them to conquer. God bless"
q4sWUJxjc4g,hahahahahahahahahah. The hypocrisy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham i respect you , Maureen I salute you ..Cera I bow to you ..you guys are amaizing  this is true true and its responsibility on the highest level... i respect you . This Empire is great"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is their own business let me mind mine I have nothing to say for now.
q4sWUJxjc4g,God us seeing this aki ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Does this man even make love to serah for real??😳😳😳😳Ama ni uko kwingine ingine 💁💁💁 chaaaaiiiiiii 🤦🤦
q4sWUJxjc4g,He prefers light coloured women. Sarah is darker and is actually a lot prettier. I feel terrible for Sarah this is sexual emotional abuse. She had has no choice apart from walking away. It would actually be advisable for her to walk away now while still young to find someone else or be a single parent. The other woman is more calculating and l don't see her remaining in a peaceful relationship with Sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My question is, do they all sleep in masters bedroom or how do they go about it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eishhh my heart is aching n am not sera.......A silent woman is a dangerous one...... am just imagining what sera is planning to do in her mind
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cant watch this video, the heading alone speaks volumes... where is the selflove dear ladies. why settle for this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is so hurt may God give e her inner eyes to leave this betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Surely Goodness and Mercy this is a very tender age to share lov...cerah is just looking Abraham with alot of lov...she did not deserve that  haki... she even  mentioned when she got married the dad was like ""Ngai Wacera wakwa""... then imagine....""kuhikiririo""... ...aaaaaaai..............Wish you all  well......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes to Cera, the facial expression and the the deep breaths she's taking indicates she is yet to  recover."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True she is still hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's heart and love is with the one he cheated with.
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Absolutely 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,At least someone is seeing what am seeing . she is totally uncomfortable . secondly the man showed he wanted something different from the first wife ( the physics of the second wife )
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Selah looks beautiful 😍 to me I don't know, but she looks like a great woman!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,IAM AGAINST POLYGAMY PERIOD😔😔😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry to Judge but this guy is materialistic
q4sWUJxjc4g,"maureen kaa ukijua wewe ni shuhe , cerah i like ur heart   not many women can accept to leave together"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Interesting
q4sWUJxjc4g,The moment selah said 'i knew Maureen was going nowhere 'she was left with no choice but to stay and make it work
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Queen TC You're  not so smart if you think like this
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Queen TC you should go to school to know how to write properly. Your writing is truly a mess.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Queen TC true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Exactly she loves him, she feels she has no choice. God give you grace cera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The money aspect from Maureen that he is getting too is there huum.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaeeyy Lynn it's been a while..And I'm here for your savage questions 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You're simply the best interviewer of this era - is all I can say about this video 🙌🏾🙌🏾😁😁
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Maureen is first of all very old to intrude into this beautiful n young family. Let's revisit this after 5 yrs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To Abraham's empire:
Congratulations👏👏
What you have managed to do especially in a westernised 21st century is nothing short of a miracle. 
That said, Abraham said he believes in God. 
This is my prayer for your family;
""May God teach you (Abraham) to be impartial to both of your wives and to always love, care for, respect, cherish and honor their love and trust in you all the days of your life. May you be kind, compassionate of their needs and always provide for them with equity in Jesus' holy name, amen. 
Thanks for sharing your story with us. 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haki Abraham! You have heaven on earth.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is hurting,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"strange thing is Maureen really did not want to deal with that question of what if a 3rd wife comes? yet she it's very much possible and also how would her parting shot be if you are the second wife stay in your home or space yet she moved in? Anyway let me drink some water and mind my business, It's a full time job"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is courting an Early death.. hes so selfish to Sarah.. I hope one day she moves away from that bullshit at least emotionally n gets love elsewhere
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And one day Serah when you finally gather the courage to leave this sad unimaginable situation, call us for a party. It shall be well Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'd love to attend. Party out of a narcissistic relationship is worth it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray for Sarah. May she love herself enough to do so
q4sWUJxjc4g,Drinks on me that day
q4sWUJxjc4g,🔊🔊
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sure she is planning exit no matter how long it will take
q4sWUJxjc4g,this one av just watched a few minutes....not my cup of tea!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Two women sharing the same D:) living in the same house and claim to be cool with each other? This is a pure lie
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This one drained my energy had to pause and watched  it the next day wueeeeeeeh ni painful.
This is not ordinary grace oooooh eiiiiiish🥺😖extra dosage of grace. 
To SERAH❤❤💪💪💪
to the whole family wishing  you all the best"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wonderful people will always support your work and everything you do I know the fatherless children now have a way out and also the dads out there hiding their support  now have found a breakthrough through your stories that you share out here on Social Media platforms. Am one of the people who used to hide but I came to Learn through my friends how kids especially innocent kids, how desperately need our support.  I love you guys genuinely ❤️ kudos Ronald from Texas"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I Feel so bad for Cerah, it is not easy to endure all that and you have to be okay.May God continue to give you grace coz wueeh!!!!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is pure nonsense,you deserve better, Abraham is such a loser!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wacha mimi ni seme ""mapenzi wewe"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,Get ready for the third one.Huyu bado ataenda tu mac macoffee  dates....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"infact let us talk the truth, when God created Adam ,He brought one woman from His ribs not two,so on my side this is so painful to share a husband  even if cera is talking outsidely hmmm there is pain inside."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If I was Serah I would have left unapologetically. I cannot and will never entertain such kind of nonsense. There's no happiness in such a situationship. This guy has
some arrogance in him. Haikosi Serah haikosi aliambiwa uitikie hii arrangement ama uende"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad that yo loved one can comfortably talk about getting someone else in yo eyes!!men can be selfish!!BETRAYAL just!!!I feel for Cerah. Sorry dear shz smiling thru her pain.she seems so sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow....this is so unbelievable.....lreally love this...people need to follow this coz its brave
q4sWUJxjc4g,You wanted him to live her ... btt dont go and buss sarah around
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second one feeling Guilty..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Second wife looks happier than cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Frist I must say thanks to Lyn for a job well done. You asked all the question that I would love. For Cerah, I feel it for you so much. I can see that see suffers from a low self-esteem and this is the reason why Abhram is abusing her. Cerah, stop tell other that you are fine because you are not. It shows on you. You don't have to do this. you are not a school child. Why would you suffer yourself just to be with a guy who didn't see it fit to be with you in the first place? girl wake up you are not a child anymore. Its later than you think. This will not last. This is not pleasing to your Maker. God has better for you. Maureen: while i know of a fact that others can fall in love with someone else's spouse, this is your worst mistake. you should have done this moving in that house. Where is your worth? what is your hope? In this day and age, you should be far more away from this garbage than choose to wake up history. You are a sweet girl who should be at a higher price. Why do you settle for 'second'? Do you think your daughter will be happy later in this life with what you did?  This is not of God so please do not allow this cheater to sugar you ladies. he is an open player. read God's word for yourself and find out what he likes. It hurts so much Maureen of what you are doing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man will get a third ,fourth and fifth one. Will you condense them in one house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen keeps on calling her Sarah instead of Sera..... I hate it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham. Had many sons....afadhali nikae peke yangu..The man is happy..Maureen is happy but Cera is not happy truth be told
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera u don’t deserve this betrayal.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, Serah and Maureen. Thank you for choosing Love. I admire your journey."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is terrible, he needs Jesus. And maurren leave that marriage alone! Wth"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They will fill pain when their children undergo to same, but they won't remember they are the genesis. In Jesus seek let wealth not make us to appreciate evil."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am going through comments to see weather Am they only have negative feelings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Ngugi soo happy for you asking those tough questions but the thing is Maureen should keep off Serah”s Marriage period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nilikuwa napitia kwaumbali coz some story...... I come here coz of going through comments
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Strange story,but these frequent interviews and negative comments may cause a dent to the family being humans."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Somethings are just madness of the highest level 🤣. I can't do it. And btw the first wife is the most beautiful😍✨❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Panacea for multiplicity of single parents
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kwani Huyu Abraham ndio disagreement zilimpata peke yake😏😏😏,,watu hudisagree Na later things gets better..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera stop pretending,, it's not well with you..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Huyu Abraham ni wanaume wenye huwa hawatosheki,and he seems to be very manipulative, and as long as he gets what he wants everyone doesn't matter."
q4sWUJxjc4g,😭Narc
q4sWUJxjc4g,"YOU ARE A DESTROYER, YOU COULD HAVE FOUND YOURS, NONSENSE 😏😏😏😏😏😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think I can tell how this movie will end. This guy atafanywa kitu hajawai ona by the 2nd wife and will come back crying to cera.... it's tht simple. I have kids with 2/3 different women and let no one tell you tht it's okay for either of them knowing leave alone living together.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moureen be strong. Stop giving people a chance to discourage you. Abraham and Sarah loves you. And I also love you. Cheer up girl.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You guys stop lying to us .....pretenders are worse than murderers
q4sWUJxjc4g,God punish you Abraham! For putting your wife cera through this. She seems like an amazing genuine person any man would love to have her as a wife. My prayer is she is able to see her worth and leave this nonsense arrangement. I pray she leaves and meets someone who would treat her with so much love and respect and she would never have to share a man she loves. Such a heart breaking story.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't worry karma knows his address.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's a true narcissistic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am just bitter watching it!! I just hate this Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera has  stockholm syndrome. She needs help. Stockholm syndrome is a psychological condition that occurs when a victim of abuse identifies and attaches, or bonds, positively with their abuser. 
These individuals like Sera are generally not harmed   by their captors ""Abraham and Maureen"" but are always treated with kindness and sympathy.Deep down Sera aint happy. 😔😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow, yeah .. that's it and this is what cost so many abuse victim's happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To me i don't want to lie,i can't but this is my decision anyway."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn your questions are on point.My heart goes out to Serah.Abraham n Maureen should have some shame if not remose .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah's painful story
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moureen looks older than Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeeh I have nothing to say...can't judge....have learnt something from this....
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is such a narcissist. How do you do this to your wife? Cerah why do u tolerate such nonsense? Wah... I kent. Infact Cerah is prettier than Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Lynn, l love the show and your interviewing skills. Let is definately something for us to learn. I appreciate the respectful character of Maureen  to Cerah, but more importantly, Cerah, you are a woman of adorable character. Thank you for your understanding, being so calm and giving Maureen a chance. To Abraham, your first statements to Cerah, when she asked you were so painful. But any way, things have worked out, and continue respecting each other. Abraham, you have a duty to love these two ladies coz they are both adorable."
q4sWUJxjc4g,nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Madness!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@frashiermwihaki7453 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureeeen you wronged cerah  apologise as you move on
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera hataki kuitwa single mum hio ndio inamkalisha hapo
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Rg
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mareen respect yourself and walks out of someone home and marriage you are hurting Cerah ..you are destroying your fellow woman and pretend to love her like a friend and a sister ..you are a pretender very rich and beautiful you will find your own man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera God will bless you. Imagine those humble beginnings.And always men see others nooooot fair
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hope Serah is Happy.from what I see there's alot than what meets the eye. Body language talks more than words. Abraham try to balance love .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is a very calm lady,,,I love how Lyn  is interviewing them,,,atiiii?how do you go out with onother lady and yet your married...men.men🤔🤔🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,am sure Abraham's parent were so happy for Wacerah..she looks so humble and loving...
q4sWUJxjc4g,From the way Maureen speaks you can tell she is a fake person😏🤯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After watching this story on 2 platforms,this is what I have deducted ; Cera loves Abraham and wanted to be with him, when the other lady wasn't living with them, Abraham never gave her attention (the kumenyesha excuses) so to solve the situation, she invited Maureen to live with them since that is the only way she could be with Abraham. Woi aki mapenzi wewe! But kuna self love, na ata kama Abraham anasema they can't leave with his kids, the courts would grant custody to the mother."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ukweli ni hii,Serah loves this man way too much"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree with you completely
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't help thinking what it would feel like if Cera was my sister or daughter. It would break my heart even though she made the decision to stay. I pray for her good heart. I really hope she finds peace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She needs to know we'll be her online sister's and support her when she's ready to walk away
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to you Serah. Out here your are a hero to many...Your beautiful and very composed. Many God give you grace each day.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's nothing I learn from here ,,,only I can say cerah you're a strong woman, after all the betrayal u still put a smile on your face may God see u through."
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no way a man can love 2 women the same  poor Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy feels like he is God's gift to the women...I can't,the jealousy and envy that usually is in polygamous marriages is not something to admire."
q4sWUJxjc4g,what if he is
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wait untill they all hit over forty five, the mans energy will have dimished, kids grown, they will both get mipangos, the man will now live under their terms, i pray GOD empowers ceera, and raise her esteem, right now its too low and she looks lost and confused."
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,He really had to betray this pure soul?🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a big scaaam
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do I have words for this man kweli...Serah no matter what you say you are not ok..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why do men think they can hold  a woman because of a child, eti wewe uende na uniwachie watoto wangu, my friend don't pull this on me, Shually😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It moved from “ go to your wife” to spreading legs
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is BS.🚮🚮🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man Abraham is just something else just build a different house for your second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Huyu serah alipedwa juu ya kuosha nyumba na nguo,mjinga yeye,alfu from 2014 to 2022 she got 3 kids in that short span of time.no wonder she accepted a second wife in her own HSE.huyu nkipatana naye nampea slap ya kimataifa aamke"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wah... Maybe she's having them for herself... Then she suffers from Stockholm syndrome. Bado hajijui.... If I were her I'd quit... We are only doing this life once... Imagine living all your life feeling unappreciated and inadequate. I can't.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow!!! Guys u are 1 in a million. What matters a lot ni hiyo respect you have for each other.respect!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacheni ufala! Si the women also bring men into the relationship and say they're going nowhere after getting pregnant tuone ikienda beyond mapenzi.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am sorry 😞 to say this but some men, some men,some men 🥺lemme reserve my words though it’s not always good to hurt someone’s feelings. Married men settle down for once"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hahaha this just for time being!! Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn's investigative skills are on another level 🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Question for Abraham is not planning for 3rd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,He doesnt love serah.He keeps her because she is a homemaker and maybe for the sake of not losing his kids?He is more attracted to maureen both sexually and intellectually for the sake of his business
q4sWUJxjc4g,"100%. The way he described how he was attracted to Serah because of heels"" But he speaks alot more about how he was attracted to Maureen cause of her ethic and character"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"GOD HELP CERA/Sera to make her best decision. She will be better off living on her own, rather than living with such a manipulative marriage where, the 2nd wife is promoting for more wives to come..The man is in his 30s, by the time he is in 40 years how many wives will he be having? Cera is denying herself by claiming that she is okay. Cera's demeanour while talking that ""she is happy, shows how down she's is. The 2nd wife is also  highly manipulative. CERA NEEDS TO ADMIT THAT SHE'S NIT OK. SHE SAYS SHE OK, WHILE HER FACE SHOWS HE DEEPEST SORROW. THE SECOND WIFE, DOESN'T SHOW IN HER HAPPINESS IN HER TALKS. CERA YOU ARE IN PAIN, WHILE YOUR CO-WIFE IS THE ONE, WHO IS  DOMINANT. CERA'S PAST EXPERIENCES MAKES HER TO PERSEVERE. CERA'S PAST HAS GIVEN THE HUSBAND TO SUBDUE THE WIFE TO NOTHINGNESS."
q4sWUJxjc4g,100%
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am just seeing selfish people here Abraham and maurine, Abraham sounds a don't care ,and maurine came to destroy this marriage, may God's grace be upon cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah , hope one day you be happy, 🙏🙏🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A not-so-good example. It may mislead others. To make matters complicated, the two women leaving under the same roof. One is a subordinate and she doesn't realize it, leaving in denial."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why do you guys speak your language while other tribes are watching?
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is toxic!daaamn
q4sWUJxjc4g,With no Judgment... its an interesting story to watch! takes guts to just be different ! big up for being you and doing you Empire family!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Give cera a chance to speak
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy though🤦🤦🤦
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Abraham TALKING OF ""ABRAHAM'S EMPIRE"" tells of Abraham's  EGOISM & MANIPULATIVE BEHAVIOUR."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen looks older than Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope your arrangement works. we should revisit after 10years.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu jama is controlling wooooooi 😡😡😡😡
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man telling of Sara's child's pains, shows how  EGOISTIC &  Manipulative he is. He doesn't show feelings concerning his child's feelings. @Lyn I wish you can analyse this story in a separate video, to discuss manipultion from the man and 2nd wife.Here is a question of powerlessness on the part of Sera, while Abraham & Maureen have the power, making them to arrogantly talk of their intrusive relationships. @Lyn  Overromantazation of this Three-some is a sheer lie."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Three what???😝🥱
q4sWUJxjc4g,THERE IS SOME TRUTHS MAUREEN AND ABRAHAM ARE NOT SAYING AND HAVE BEEN HIDING FROM CERAH....WTF! CERA IS BEAUTIFUL..If it was for maureen to accept in Cerah..it could be CHAAAAAAAAOS!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'll never accept this unless over my dead body
I'm that jealous guy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi watu wa miwani hapana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man and wives are promoting promiscuousness as a romantic affair, while it's not true. This man is very manipulative and narcissistic."
q4sWUJxjc4g,cereh you have a golden heart i just cant beleive its happening like this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah will always be affected. It seems she stayed because she had no other option. This laughing from the 2nd wife and husband, shows of thier egoistic greedy behaviours. The intruder, 2nd wife is just sugarcoating. Sera, ON THER HAND,  just accepted a situation she didn't have control over. She chose diplomacy and denied herself love and tender care, for her own existence,  BUT SHE IS HURTING, BADLY."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah umesema huwezi kanyagiwa na hujapangwa but we can see the pain in your eyes mamaa. And the truth is Abraham loves maureen more than you,  Hata venye anaangalia maureen he is so inlove with her than  he loves you, venye anamsifia aki si venye anakusifia adi nimefeel vibaya. If i could advice you mamaa i could tell you to ruuuun."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hate how he keeps saying ""sasa huyu"" 🚮"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is the reason behind that family. She should be blessed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"aky mi i can,t.........."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is hurt, even her voice says,, sorry babygal"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's something wrong in all this, huyu jamaa ni manipulator and cerah is in pain you can see through her eyes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"uweeeeeeee,,,,I don't know why am shedding tears,,,to Lynn ngugi bravo 👏 for the questions you asked"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"mmmh....okay. Not here to criticize the couple but something smells fishy. If it was not for Cerah finding Maureen's pics Abraham was not planning to tell her and this would have ended up with him leaving Cerah for Maureen. Getting a second wife should be a conversation (with the first wife) before it even happens. I feel like Cerah was ambushed into accepting this new relationship. To many women, when you have invested in a man, the thought of leaving him and to top it off...because of another woman...its a tough pill to swallow. And Maureen  keeps on repeating the statement, 'Abraham is very convincing...', in my opinion, it comes off a bit manipulative. At some points when the ladies are giving their sides of the story, the look at him as if trying to get approval of what to say: they start a statement they look at him and they are like,...'do you remember that time....' This feels rehearsed at some points. Unfortunately the more i watch this interview the more the thought of how it is easy for men to move on and leave the women in catch 22 situations keeps ringing in my mind ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah I hope you find peace and courage of walking out from those woes nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The level of sadness,betrayal,heart break on  Serah's eyes when Abraham was explaining how he met Maureen until when he broke the message to her that he has a child with Maureen just made me freeze ...Abraham you have destroyed Maureen's self esteem...hiyo part where he explains about traditional marriage with Serah I felt like slapping him"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too I feel pain this man is so selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@mercywanjiru9444 This man is the real definition of egocentricism, male chauvinism and betrayal. How do u go about cheating on your wife when the marriage is so new, when she is pregnant and u give such lame excuses, u go cheating without protection! Tena with a woman way older than the first wife, anyone who is not blind can see tha! I won't say a less beautiful too, mmhhh....and now coz Cera didn't go away as the man and moreen expected, they are now capitalizing on her staying by looking for fame with it! What opportunists!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"not really self esteem but rather the betrayal hurt and pained her alot, it's still all over her eyes."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Actually he didnt tell her he met maureen and has a kid. Sarah found out while scrolling and he gaslighted her by asking ""why were you going through my phone"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah, you are a special lady.
Abraham you betrayed cerah's love for you.Your love is so instrumental.You didn't marry mourine out of genuine love but to use her to make money.
Mourine, walking to another woman 's marital house to sleep with her husband is so weird.common sense was needed.
Don't think that Cerah is comfortable with you in her house, but she has done it to save her marriage.
Going public has only made Cera a heroine, not you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a lucky man 👨
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera atleast if not for you just think of your kids, how will this sanitized promiscuity affect them, their peers are brought up by a father and mother.... just let the 2 adults drowned in lust be and ask the bare minimum of your space and your kids."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't believe in this thing of saying somebody is comfortable with a co wife. If it's true then this Serah is one in a million.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that you brought the second wife while your marriage was still young shows that you were not ready to settle with Cera. When you found Morin you were like ' I wish I met you earlier' n that tell it all that you love Cera as mother of your kids and moreen is your heart beat. Look at how you told Cera when she found out about Morin. Ati Morin had your daughter and you love her so much. Who does that? Anyway it has already been done n I wish you all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,"youve spoken my mind, this man though. Toxic"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Toxic kabisa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"to anyone reading this, may your household never face this kind of embarrassment and betrayal in Jesus' name . AMEN. TO serah, I pray one day you get the strength to leave  this man. amen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let her stay she has not committed any sin but the second adulterer shld leave coz she knew there was someone else
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ameeeen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is hurting just like every woman would.  She only realized she cannot change her man's decision and because she still loved him she spared the energy fof fighting back  or else shewoud loose him.  Abraham and Maureen took the advantage of her softness  and goodness. Tryly speaking this is not fair and just a matter of time and true self will start showing. Otherwise I wish the family well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One story on this show that I have disliked. This is unacceptable and it is sad that we are trying to normalise it. Cera, may you find the courage to wak out of this entanglement you are in. You are worth much much more."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By now after all these interviews we know the most loved wife.
What are these interviews for by the way? They're everywhere."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the Man and his second wife are seeking Validation...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"2nd wife looks like mother in law.Anyway, she's Abraham's  another taste"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sikatai co-wife but mtu ajengewe kwake. living together is a no for me. Hiyo audacity imeenda group of schools. Weeuh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Have you seen how when the baby has started crying both ladies eyes popped,,,motherly instincts"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hmmm! Cera is strong 💪 
Abraham and Maureen shouldn’t have gone this far.
I personally can’t tolerate such."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Scary stuff. Men should be trained as young boys to have good values. No sane man can keep two women under one roof and having sex with them whether same time or different time. Cerah so sorry you were traumatised by a man you trusted. He betrayed you. Abraham you need help. This is promiscuous behaviour. You cannot normalise this. Sex is intimate.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is hurting 🥺i feel for her,this is hurting and painful😭the other one doesn't seem bothered,Serah is a strong woman and she loves her marriage ❤️🙏you are in my prayers Serah🙏that man is yours alone,he will come to realize one day,pole mum"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I never get to comment on anything here but on this, noo, Abraham did Serah dirt! And honestly speaking she’s not happy she’s only hanging on coz of the kids and all that, being a woman It will never sit well with me my husband marrying another woman and we are Christians! Maureen and Abraham are disrespectful PERIODT!! Maureen you are a home wrecker"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How did I bring myself to listen to this is the question in my mind! Something is just not right! Abraham.calls it unique, I call it some mess of some sort! May my daughters never get into such a situation. Just wondering if Maureen would like this for her daughter?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just give each space period
q4sWUJxjc4g,This one No. Mimi u bring another woman I leave.  But her first wife does not look happy. I believe God and his word is never wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueeeeh! This is the most  painful  story i have  watched this year.  To be honest, there's nothing Interesting about Abraham as a guy, pride and  selfishness is written all over him.  my  heart goes out to Serah, mummy may  God step in fully for you  in this......Maureen, karma never loses an address,  it's even more worrying that you also have a daughter.  Retrace your steps and  re- write a good story before it's too late."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My thoughts too.this Maureen Lady will surely see karma at some point.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't  trust  this  guy he's  a womanizer, at the  end  of  the  tunnel  there's  fire, I feel it for  Sarah,Maureen  you  will  pay,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah. Maureen intentionally got involved with a married man akatulia tu because cerah is kind
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@patricianabende7674 yeh  Sarah is kind  but deep down  this marriage  is  toxic  to  her,but Maureen  is a passing  wind  when she finished  her  deal  she  will  leave, she's not there  to  stay,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So so sad sad for sarah,she deserved more,,being cheated by botb wonder how the man  and morrie would have felt if sarah did the same ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No,we can't be glorifying adultery like this..these two had no regard whatsoever for Cerah's feelings..this is the kind of hurt that never goes away"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I refuse to glorify this nonsense! I blame this dog of a man but I also blame this Maureen lady, home wrecker!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Exactly!
The fact that cera, who only found out about her hubbys affair when her baby saw a photo of Maureen's son on the phone, has accepted this situation does not make it right
I feel like cera is still in the process of taking all this in, and maybe for now,her only option is to accomodate Maureen, so as not to lose completely. ...but the whole truth is deep somewhere in her heart
Because she didn't have a choice
Her only choice after being cheated on was lose her whole marriage,or accept whatever piece of himself the husband had decided to reserve for her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree this is so wrong 😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes the bible is against it ......time of judgement will come...as human beings we can't judge God will do it
q4sWUJxjc4g,This doesn't sit well with me. Poor Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No, Sarah is the bigger person here. There's nothing wrong with polygamy if there's respect  between all the parties concerned.  The problem with most African men is that they disrespect the first wife and encourage the small house to do same. Now that I'm older, I know that when a man cheats, he not taking anything away from you. The lies and disrespect are not necessary at all. Also, protection from HIV  is important.  When you cheat, protect those you claim to love. Who are to judge."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Our great grandparents had several wives but they all lived in separate houses. To me this is absurd. I’m not blaming Cerah but low self esteem has led to her accepting all the BS from father Abraham. It’s apparent that this father Abraham loves Maureen more than Cerah , that’s why he can’t openly claim who is first wife and second. And if he loves Cerah as he claims he does, he wouldn’t have gone for the second wife. Nie reke nemwo , there’s too much hypocrisy behind closed doors. Cerah is just naive and loves this father Abraham to see his wrongs. Being too nice makes you a rundown! Just my two cents  ✌️ 😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen should have opted to get her own separate home.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everything is wrong about this whole arrangement. I cannot even watch the whole interview. Too distressing. What a selfish man. Will not end up well. God does not bless such unions.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is one million dollar question Lynn forgot to ask what if Maureen's daughter calls her one day and tells her that her husband has a side chick will she tell her that it's not a big deal...and to Abraham what if one day his daughter calls him to tell him that her husband has a sidechic would he tell her it's no big deal???
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can she say anything if she is a home wrecker? Karma comes.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a betrayer but thanks for Sera she's one in a million
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes out to serah... Maureen is just a home breaker I know what serah is going through she had no option but to accept and am sure it's for the sake of her people...she never wanted to dissapoint her dad who seemed to be disappointed when she got married 
Serah God is with you...may Maureen never find peace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Blasphemy,,,let only God judge her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Queen TC yes, our ancestors married many wife’s but what are the results? Try to find out….no happy ending"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Queen TC if you are honest with yourself it’s mostly sad stories. You can barely hear happy ones.
Just review the comments here and compare narratives of happy polygamy versus those of the sad. Simple statistics….."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@graceconstance1226 They are on my YouTube feed so i will judge them! If you want only God to judge you don't come to YouTube streets.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let's leave judgment to God and just wish them well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abram. Sarai. Haggai.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife is this man's dream woman. That's the woman he loves. The 1st wife is what he settled for. The 2nd wife the one he chose and his heart's desire. The apple of his eye. His type of woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's 44.12 for me when Lynn asked the guy what about love?did he just have to abandon whatever he felt for cerah just to be with another woman...this is just so cringe to watch
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is not happy at all she had to agree no one can be happy for your husband brings in another woman in your marriage never...may God help her and give her strength I knew she can't express it....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah doesn't seem like she is happy..morine seems happy and is like she spends more time with hubby. Why coffee dates abd yet they have been at work together,  Abraham should be rushing home to see Sarah after a long day at home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Licking his lips when he talks..shows how decieving he is...disgusting man
q4sWUJxjc4g,the moment you're sleeping with a married man and you know you're a home wrecker
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera loves the guy but the opposite is not true. He said he had  arguments frequently with sera that could lead him to Maureen. That's a lie!! The arguments were there since he already had someone else who he thought was better that sera. A true faithful man could not have encouraged the coffee dates.  The two ladies are competing unconsciously hence why the guy wears ironed socs. One day punda atachoka!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen wewe Wachana na family ya wenyewe
q4sWUJxjc4g,All Maureen needs is the right man for a husband. Let her believe God for a man instead of disturbing Cerah coz Cerah cannot reach her full potential as a wife and mother because she is being robbed of her full portion
q4sWUJxjc4g,Denial and selfishness...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If Abraham has chosen the polygamy way, the LEAST he could do is ensure each of his wives has a house. What are they teaching their children by him shifting between two bedrooms at night in the same house? Weuh! I cannot ..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,SARAH is hurting inside. Abraham is SELFISH. Sarah is optional. Look at the way Abraham looks in Maureen's eyes but can't put his eyes on Sarah. Looks like he is avoiding her.l pray Sarah finds happiness again. Not happy with Maureen having moods in the house. I feel like she will eventually take over the running and decisions of the family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs to Maureen and Cerah continue being friends, raise your family together and don't be discouraged by people. Kirindi kiaremire musa. It's not a wonder most of the negative comments are coming from mpango wa kando people."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is petty,,she was light skin and in heels,,man up,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like their story Serah you are the best.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah take heart God is with you.you are beautiful in and out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is insane...how on earth does he put these two ladies in one roof. Honestly the world has gone crazy and Jesus is soon coming back.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People treat you how u want them to,hope Serah will know her worth one day she deserves better,she's so pretty to share a man"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like it either.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that the entire union started on a lie. He lied to her about maureen and having a kid with her. It can never be genuine. It's manipulation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too i cant
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel Sera's pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,She deserves better than this  😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so cringeworthy. I could not watch it to the end. Eiyyy!!!! My heart goes out to Serah. I hope she gets the courage to choose herself and walk out of this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope he does not go for number 3. But it is too early time will come when the empire will start having cracks

q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah should leave him. Both he and the second wife are wicked! Women need to love themselves. It pains my heart to watch this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is 2022. Maureen and Abraham disadvantaged Cerah. Abraham, an opportunist male states “ it is nature of business”. Really? All professionals work with opposite  sexes and still need to maintain formal decorum. Let us call it what it is, Abraham cheated on Cerah and decided to eat his cake and have it…. for romances, sex and to promote his business. Too bad for Cerah who tolerated having co wife. Period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I understand Maureen, her initial wish to not be involved with Abraham once she she found out he has a wife, she felt guilty.  I like the way she continually asked about Serah and her child. Her respect for Serah..Serah I love your initial words to Maureen. My mother was a first wife as well, she loved all the children."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ma Lynn, you are a great interviewer and awesome listener. You are truly gifted to pull out information from others in subtle strategies. I am not from Kenya, yet I follow you and enjoy your stories. Kudos sis!!!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man seems to love Maureen so much, everyone is beautiful in her own ways"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham it's one thing to impregnant a woman outside ur ""marriage"" & another to feel so comfortable to even bring her inside ur home. Maureen u talk too much for a second wife.  Mistaken to think that Cera' is ur friend. Wow parting shot from Maureen ""if u can be a second wife pls do"" u are so bold."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaaw I cried for this amazing human being what a lovely family be blessed congratulations Abraham's empire,the beautiful ladies ❤ 💖 ♥ 💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Reading through the comments gives a clear picture of how society is very ready, willing and feels empowered to judge and force opinions on other people's stories. This family is telling out their story. Maybe this is one of those polygamous families that are blessed to treat each other well regardless of the challenges. Mwenye anaoa Bibi moja anaambiwa vile watawachana, mwenye anaolewa na a person with disability anaambiwa ameona Mali, Abraham angeoa wanaume mungeongea tu.... Listen more speak less!

q4sWUJxjc4g,"But they brought their business into the public domain and people must have an opinion. If they didn't want to be ""judged"" they should have kept their business private...

Also, you cannot dictate how people will perceive an issue. If you are comfortable with such an arrangement it is ok..  If someone else is not, it is ok too..

After all,, I don't see how people's opinions are going to directly impact their lives. If they break due to these comments, it just goes to show they are not as strong as they are portraying themselves to be."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah won't last in this marriage,nimewatch interview mingi zao na anaendelea kuwa hurt and sad,The guy seems Cerah amemuinua sana kwa life and he was guilt to ask her to leave,they will be left alone and Maureen will not make him happy and they will separate too,"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen I feel like your a pretender and sera I pray God gives you strength to walk away from mediocrity you deserve more and more
q4sWUJxjc4g,How does he deal with this back in school. Ukiitwa meeting?? How do your children  relate with this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Having your own cake and eating  it at the same time. Apa kila mtu atafutiwe nyumba
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would NEVER tolerate this!!! Never!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This a perfect example of Cain generation...no shame with what is ungodly. May God. anyway no comment their children will live to tell us the stories. Men 99% of us are not Sara so don't follow Abraham.
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are so happy together
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah ain't happy...she didn't enjoy her marriage.. everything about the other lady is a lie! Huyu ni mjuaji tena sana! Ati she doesn't go clubbing yet i saw a photo of them in a bar lols
q4sWUJxjc4g,This not something to shout loud about. Abraham you are to blame misleading a lady when you are married. You advise the youth to avoid your mistake (sin) and be faithful to their wives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"BIG LOVE TO CERAH,,,,,, i know this type of men kwanza wa kuramba lips OMG Kuhanyahanya tu.
Moureen even confirmed he is lovable whenever she felt like quiting anarudi tu.

Cerah Told her kuja tupamabane na yeye coz she already knew him ,this was no a news to her so no need to get angry.And since she said Abraham is the only luck in her life she couldn't even contemplate loosing him so she had to play calm. i salute your maturity.

But if it was moureen who was the first wife from the look of things, wacha tu. so  respect to her is no choice.

I hope now Abraham is settled....ama no.3 is loading....

Anywho I wish you the best."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Busy reading judgements after we were clearly told not to judge… 😜😜😜😜
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you have clearly said that you are okay and we should stop feeling sorry for you but I can't help it. You have a beautiful heart  and you don't deserve to be in this situation, but kama uko sawa itabidi tukuwe sawa pia sisi."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera all the way
q4sWUJxjc4g,"my heart goes to Cerah, she loves the man more than he loves her...i would have left"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't . This is madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a great family,  God bless you 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really feel bad for Serah.. I know Abraham as a nice guy but womeeeeeennnnnn…🙄🙄🙄🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have watched this story and the first wife Sarah is a weak character who is being used by Abraham and Maurine too bad for her.If you can't teach people how to treat you,they will treat you like a door Matt, ladies let's learn to love ourselves and walk away,Sarah agreed to this bcoz she had no job but has she ever asked herself what if Abraham died? hangeishi?.Right now if Abraham dies she will be more disadvantaged , Maurine works with Abraham she knows everything about him including ATM and etc, for her to agree to be brought to that same house where Sarah lives she could be the real owner of that house ,the house can actually be under her name, ladies be careful with ladies working with your husbands,they are sleeping with them,thank me later ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's like Abraham and the second wife spends alot of time together.if you've watch all the interviews,Cerah says she always tell Abraham amemtupa sana😥she had to accept,she had no option! But weeeuh!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is really faking her smile,on the bottom of her heart aki she ain't good,,ilimbidi akubali tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When serah said that she's ever been unlucky in life and that her life has been with ups and downs bt ended up saying that since she met Abraham she's  the happiest, I think she diverted bcz she wanted to say that she's  ever been unlucky in her life bt since they were to praise the man she had to say that,bt from the look she's  not happy at all bt she's  to be humble nothing else."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"hmm  Cera is a very intelligent woman  but also too  condoning, but God will fight for her, Abraham seems a selfish wussy just with unnecessary confidence and alot of english and without self control and intelligence but also under attach by the spirit of lust together with Maureen they need deliverance. Cera is the only true wife of Abraham and sooner or later Maureen will come into acceptance and find her place.  Though i dont know why Cera is still attracted to Abraham he looks and sounds very unattractive gosh.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am telling you there is a mystery here:Sarah is controlled  she fears and loves Abraham so much: on the other hand Abraham loves Morren more
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is this man justifying cheating openly and still being given free airtime by the media? Let Serah love herself enough and stop taking crap from the guy. What people accept in the name of love! Weeuuhh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wander if serah could not agree to stay could this Ibrahim stop her  anyway when the deal is soo good think twice
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes to Serah....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ningemtia makofi niharibu siyo sura, anyway i dont like it, i feel for Cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why is this Mwangi saying that it is God's doing? You don't involve/ drag God in your bad choices and say its him! I have  a feeling that this man is a manipulator. Number 1 because he has money,  he is. Mwangi that has good looks unlike other men! 
The first wife had no choice by the look of her body language she has decided and made up her mind she ain't going nowhere, why??  Kids are involved and she doesn't want to leave this man with another wife. 
Thirdly, this 2nd wife knew very well this man was married why did she agree to take it further and have this man to her bedroom? She said she had blocked him, right? So why continue to go on those coffee  dates. Maureen you should have stopped from  the day you knew this man is married!

I feel like this Mwangi is nothing but a selfish person in life. He wants to fulfill his  bodily desire, when he gets bored with the other he goes to the other woman. This man also commented that he has his socks ironed, right? .... That w how he likes it almost like being worshipped. Both women have decided not to let go because  they won't find another person who can match this mans looks and a well presented beautiful Bank statement! 
For  sure this first wife is hurting but doesn't want to say but you can tell a lot from her body language and facial expressions.  This man will bring another  young girl in this family once this 2 get to, or  approach 40... because he is so full of himself! What a waste of your soul and life Mwangi! I pity those children even in their school life hopefully they won't be bullied in school... I  don't know how school life is there... but hopefully not for those kids sake! Mmmmm the society is getting rotten here we go will see so many men following the so called disgusting trend of Abraham Mwangi! The irony is his name and the first wife's name I know she corrected it and said its not Sarah but just the pronunciation sounds the same. Mmmm life choices......sad when you have to live with a wound  for the rest of your life!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True definition of love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,God forbid
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's no love..the first wife is hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,I struggled to listen to this FAKENESS to the end…father Abraham good for you utapata mwingine huko inje mrembo and you will have an explanation why you want her too…….🙄🙄🙄I can’t 🙄🙄Lynn thanks for the good interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weehh hii emoji ya weehh ikitokea mniambie nikuje niweke apa kwa comment yangu
q4sWUJxjc4g,The mistake Serah did was to show the husband that she accepts the 'mistake' he did...her reaction gave this guy the energy to continue
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true 😥😥😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,...because she loves him more than she loves herself...and she has poor self esteem. That man made her beleive that she is nothing without him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't think that home wrecker has a right to even laugh.unaona hata wanashindwa na tough questions zenye Lyn anauliza

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woyee,,Serah ametoka mbali na bwanake then boom mkee mwenza kwa nyumba..🙁🙁🙁sorry my sister I know u are hurting but u don’t want people to  judge you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is so Evil
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hey Lynn. Thank you for this interview. I love how you ask the tough questions with so much grace and wisdom. Am watching as I read through the comments... 

This is truly heart breaking. This is wrong on all levels. Abraham has no respect for Serah. He met Maureen and soon she fit all his criteria, hardworking , in the same line of work, light-skin. And the worst part is this was just shortly after moving in with Serah. This man is so conniving, and selfish. He has such a strong hold over Serah, she couldn't even fight for her marriage once she found out he was cheating on her. 

He said he was afraid of losing Maureen if she knew he was married... What about Serah and the children? Who was more important? His family, or Maureen? He took advantage of Sera's calm nature because he knew she wouldn't do anything to stop him. He never respected their union with Serah. All those coffee dates with Maureen, yet he says their marriage was an open book, they were honest with each other. She was in the dark and when she found out, Abraham used reversed psychology and instilled some fear in her. And his excuse was that he was being defensive.

Ati ""love is unlimiting, this is the point where you go beyond love, look at what are the values beyond love, look beyond love""... Really Abraham, Really? Abraham just trying to justify his reasons for having two wives.

God will punish you... Not saying this out of spite, but it's true... The wife of your youth is the one who you will get blessings with... You will come back to seeing the worth of Serah, hope you learn your lesson before it's too late. Mtaka yote hukosa yote. For Maureen, I have no words for you. Just pray and ask for God's forgiveness and leave this family alone.
 
My heart goes out to Serah. You have a heart of gold...You have sacrificed so much for your marriage, yet you are being short-changed in this arrangement. May God give you strength mama. He will fight for you and your children. He never sleeps nor slumbers. Nothing catches Him by surprise."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham and Maureen are clearly SELFISH….ofcourse Abraham gets to eat his cake and keep it because Cerah is afraid to start again. Body language of Cerah tells it all, she is hurting and definitely expressing pain 😊the two Abraham and Maureen are UNFAIR to Cerah and are guilty about it 🤣🤣we the audience can see from the body language … Cerah is such a beautiful person from inside out …. The other two are FAKE and are in this for their selfish gains…. Cerah may God give you peace and revenge for you 🙏🏾"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man is selfish and the women are allowing themselves to be used to fulfil his selfish motives.It's very clear that they are unhappy in this relationship but are convincing themselves otherwise.The only one having fun is the man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"His heart goes to Maureen, may God help cera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very very good observation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true again if he loved cera...Maureen  would not be in the picture
q4sWUJxjc4g,Having a narcissistic man in your life is the worst thing to happen to any genuine woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do you know the meaning of 'narcissist? Abraham is nothing close to it!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@paulkamau5096 you are picturing yourself in his situation and envy of it kama hujui the signs of narcissist don’t embarrass yourself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that he says it was hard on her, she cried. He's distanced himself from her emotions As If Cerahs pain doesn't affect him in any way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true.  This love triangle needs Jesus
q4sWUJxjc4g,clearly
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These are mature individuals who know what it means to be a family. They managed to arrange themselves in a way most couples fail to do. Open and honest communications in any relationship is what's needed for long-term success. As a woman who know very well the significantly high numbers of single parent families, it's clear that the Western lifestyle has destroyed the African traditional family setup. It's time for women to re-introduce the polygamous relationship. The Christian couple relationship has failed many because it's just not natural way of living."
q4sWUJxjc4g,we are here to see more......more wives😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Family set up remains God way one man one wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Vile aliambiwa kuna wife angeachana na Abraham she just wanted to break someone's marriage,she will pay for this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah has make me to shed tears ,very strong n wise words to her husband
Really Abraham unapendwa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nimelia walai serah is indeed a great lady and deserves the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah should just walk away
q4sWUJxjc4g,Light skinned girl in heels🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huwezi penda wake wawili kwa wakati mmoja huyo mwanaume ni mnafiki!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah deserves better things in life
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very selfish guy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaaah  am also okay if Sarah is okay
q4sWUJxjc4g,he loves Maureen more than the first wife even the way he address her
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Same observation, that's why serah had to join them.  If you can't beat them join them. More grace Serah  you are full of wisdom"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@rosewageni344 true all the best for her
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've said this and so many times that what Cera did to her husband is just taming him .. period!!!!!n those who are saying that Cera should move out n love herself more are selfish .she'll meet dangerous hynas out there all men cheat even those pastors n saints.better the devil you know
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hypocrisy detected🙄Maureen claims to be ""good friends "" with Cerah & when she was dating Father Abraham she never let her know? How do you Even call this? What is father Abraham and Maureen trying to glorify? Immorality in the name of love? 
This is insanity! 
Na Cerah usipochunga utaletewa wa Tatu wa nne Hta  wa kumi 🙄🚮🚮
Have life mummie you're still young & beautiful Cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As much as Maureen try to sanitise her mistakes, she remains to be a home breaker.The emotions of Serah are so evident that she is not truly happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that Sara was first does not make her the one. Lazima mtu apatane na wakwanza maybe the second agekwa wakwanza.
q4sWUJxjc4g,yes pia yeye aliharibu ndoa ya MIlly. She had a baby with abraham. We used to call this guy Ibu
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@evelynekiruo8694 nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@alexmuinde3031  plz tell us more.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@alexmuinde3031 milly yupi? thought he said haeziachilia watoto wake?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wooow😍😍😍😍 I love the family ,,, true women out there are like Moureen and hiden but I love Moureen coming out and Serah accepting her,,,all the best guys,,,,true you can't judge what you don't understand"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Only side chicks can go all hullabaloo and wow wow on this kind of arrangement. If a man decides to have other women, let him do his shit out there but not in my house. The way he broke the news to her proves he has no respect for her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ahh the ignorance, ati he had to look at other values that go beyond love... Which ones while Love is the greatest. This guy is so clueless. He does not know what he is doing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,So tuseme Abraham anaudition for 3rd wife..lightskin pangeni line mchaguliwe
q4sWUJxjc4g,this is misleading youths
q4sWUJxjc4g,"women just respect other women too,,you don't want to loose her na uko na wife,,may such men get what they look for"
q4sWUJxjc4g,where do people get the confidence to be bold on such matters betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see the second lady being ashamed ( Facial expression don't lie) when she hears Cerah narrating how they started from nothing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah’s choice of words, ‘I had to’ severally denotes she didn’t have a choice but to accept the situation the husband had brought them to."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes because she knew she is not going to leave moureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you Lynn , many people are in the same situation but not talking about it ,if they are happy well and good!!💕💕 ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,this is just shiet😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,The devil is a liar.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a narcissist and heartless I can see full betrayal here and I wish Sarah could understand herself and move out of this toxic thing   for me I can't accept this nonsense #team one man one wife #
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At 43mins,this guy was ready to loose cerah.😪😪😪😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is so into himself.Oh God cera.. You deserve better..You and your good heart are worthy babe
q4sWUJxjc4g,No matter how much you coat sugar this Maureen will someday pay and I don't think any mother Wil be comfortable with this .third wife loading
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even lynn herself has so many questions.na Maureen alisema alijua akona wife,akianzia then at 28 mins hakujua.cerah tried all she could to save her marriage at 25min but still no😪😪😪😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is not happy at all.
She must smile at the cameras because her kids need food and shelter"
q4sWUJxjc4g,21st century hahah tuwache kudanganyana this kulast ni ngori sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,I dont support ploygamy but if the 1st wyf is oky and the 2nd has respect why not and the husband to have worked harder becoz  living with two wyf is more expensive so kama uko na mali ya kutosha and u came into agreement well and gud becoz hivi stori za side chick huwa stressing juu kuna mpaka maugonjwa .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everyone have their opinion but it's better than those men who get kids outside marriage and hide them forever only for the other wives to appear during the burial.....or men who prostitute with side chics every day...honesty is better than lies and diseases.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah loooveees Abraham, Abraham is obliged to Cerah. Abraham loves Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera oga urudi soko...you're still young,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham selfishly calculated his moves and made Sarah choose to stay or leave
Maureen same tent cos you still went ahead and got laid n gave birth for him yet you’d always pretended ‘go home’
Maureen and Abraham you need to repent and apologize to Sarah for trolling her
She’s clearly hurt
Lynn amewaweka kwa corner leo.. you can not hide the lies"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ooh my God.... Abraham is proud of himself?!?????... Mmmmh. Woooi cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ofcourse the first wife didn't have a choice.it was either akubali au atoke.😪😪😪😪
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The whole thing doesn't feel right, Serah is a strong woman..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne push him to the wall because this is not normal. How can u live with two wives in the same house? Honestly. Does it make sense really???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maurine , Maurine,  Maurine!!!!!! You are so cold 🥶"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham watch you keeping on hurting Sarah, one you appreciate to Maureen for taking good care of Sarah but you don't appreciate Sarah for all you taken her through.behind that smilling woman know she is hurting though not showing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I felt it, when she said 'aki mapenzi wewe'"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really don't support this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah your the best mummie❤❤❤hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Hell hath no fury like a scorned woman""....this Maureen lady better be careful. She cannot say she is clear when she allowed herself to conceive knowing very well Pendo was there and Cerah. Cera is tolerating everything because someone is handling her bills. I pray for her financial breakthrough, afunguke macho aone tu hapa hakuna mapenzi. Yaani this man cheats, sires a baby outside, brings the woman home and forces you to tell the world that you love this woman wooooi. Pole sana Serah, fight on your knees...you look decent, hawa wanakuchafua tu 😨😨"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At some point  in the show,  Serah's response was evidence of betrayal. Romantic betrayal is traumatizing. Not sure whether it is an admirable lifestyle but anyway, it is what it is. Who am I to judge?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, it is traumatizing... Maybe she's still in shock. I pray she heals from it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sad how Kenya has turned to.This are young beautiful women who were born to be princesses not slaves. This man is a narcissist. President uhuru failed by implementing polygamous law. women die like this with depression cera she is probably there because of her kids and maybe this man had nothing and they invested  up things together and then,she cheats on her.  That  man should stop lying to us he cannot love 2 women at the same time."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah looks slightly timid and may not be able to speak out for herself incase of anything.Sad that she's living in denial
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly cerah Is hurting, leave that marriage sis!!

You deserve better and you are so beautiful, this has broken me honestly 💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's not possible it can never be it has never been.jacob married sisters who became enemies from the same womb!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pliz This is not a Godly njeri in kikuyu is a demonic name, This is not your husband pliz"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Heck Noooo!! God gave me one Hubby 🙏 and am not Sharing My Dear. You get second Wife I will Find another Husband.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceera is the one who make Abraham where he is today
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is hurting.. Maureen ni mkora, pretending to be a good person."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow...so interesting story.Its so hard to accept but that's the reality.This is so loving and a lesson to me🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like this Maureen lady ..this man is selfish...more grace to cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you the best in interview aki the way you have handled

I hate narcissist it's too much here
hugs to Ceera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love how Lynn is digging deep and Cerah is super calm
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a cheater
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera please take care an enemy of a woman is a woman.she might be similing at your face but deep down she wants you out of the picture
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morren please live that marrege hiyo ni mpango na Mungu apendi
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is strong strong strong.l watched their story and the day that followed l was emotional all day😭😭l prayed for her and her heart.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is definitely cheating either one of this ladies you can’t serve two masters noooo.that’s why God created man and his woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a betrayal, at this century,you would have divorce Cerah instead of breaking her heart in an abusive way you don't even respect her feelings. I just blame Cerah who would like to be treated as an alternative 🙃 🙄 😕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nobody can love two ladies at same time never.hawa ni ma Lebanese jamaa ako apo tu kufunika
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One question that I have, if roles were reversed would Maureen accept cerah? I know they both underestimate the role of cerah In this relationship ,if she leaves ,this relationship cannot stand , Abraham would start to clearly see Maureen's flaws and she's clearly a very selfish person and also I have a feeling Abraham is not only an emotional abuser but more"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What #andrewkibe got to say on this one?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This one takes a different kind of grace and it's NOT for me.. I wasn't cut from that material of sharing especially a husband and they can
Portray how awesome it is but it's not kabisa and I am writing from experience.. A man's heart is very wicked and he can't love both wives equally behind closed doors is a different matter."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is it that people are not tolerant to others. Does is mean our ancestors were wrong when they had multiple wives? We just dump our minds and call ourselves educated but leave our true culture behind. Leave the family alone. Mnataka wakosane ndio mwaseme.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Definitely not for me 
Triggered in a way"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bice
q4sWUJxjc4g,You guys I wish you good luck since the guy has said they are there to live but I would say you better build a house for Maureen things can turn south 😱 like we have wanjohi's family it's also a nice family and people should stop judging that oh first wife is bitter 😏who told you let them be
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen aki leave that house for Serah😭😭🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think this man has no respect for cerah 
How can he say another woman is beautiful infront of his wife

All that proceeds from his mouth shows no love and respect for cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a torture if he was in the u.s.a it could be another story. U can't play with people heart. It's called emotional abuse. Sera God will come thru for you mama.  He's sleeping with another woman under one roof with his 1st wife. Does she get a sleep? Omg it's disheartening!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,ABRAHAM THE WAY U ARE TREATING SERA UR SISTERS WILL BE TREATED IN SAME WAY. IF THEY ARE IN GOOD TERMS U SHOULD HAVE MOVED HER IN  HER OWN AND LET SARA BE. WHY WOULD U HURT HER AND PUT A WOMAN IN SAME HOUSE. I CAN FEEL THE PAIN OF SERA . SHES PRETENDING TO BE OK.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah isn’t happy,Abraham is selfish and he didn’t end there,maurine is a murderer you could see from her face and she doesn’t even care.she knows that cerah might give up and go and she will win everything 

You are not ashamed Maurine ,breaking other peoples homes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am  so irritated by this man's selfishness.  All he thinks about is himself! So inconsiderate. Whether Cerah has accepted the situation or not, the man was only in it for himself! His lack of empathy for how humiliating this situation is for his first wife. Waah!  I am sorry for what you are going through mana. Pole sana."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All the credit goes to sarah, the way she accepted betrayal from husband and then try to accommodate co-wife takes really a clean heart but on contrary the second wife as you read her wouldn't have done these. God bless you sarah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I would love to know Lynn's reaction about this,because weuh  can't be me..hugs cerah it's gonna be okay,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"mafala wakipata pesa hufikiria tu wanawake,one day he will regret doing this to cera !!!because cera is the only wife here the other is a hustler!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is so nice yaani I feel bad this two are taking advantage of her.
May God help sera get out of this backwardness. The pain in her face...gosh!
Also Abraham is a tier 1 narcissist"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pity Sarah....hugs mum. There is no other description of maureen than a professional home wrecker. That man is a heart breaker.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is TOTAL TOTAL B.S ! The nerve!! Serah changamka! Oh please!! Enough said!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is not a must that co-wives must fight, they can live peacefully together but that depends on how the man treats them. If he starts to take sides, that's what brings problem."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah, may God give you peace, I can read the pain on your face, and how this guy mentions Maureen, Maureen...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,10 minutes in and honestly this takes my energy levels to 0. I just can't.
q4sWUJxjc4g,And am here I haven't watched it yet asking myself if its worth my time
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haya ..what kind of life honestly
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@auntyshak1778 I just came straight to comment section, am not going to listen to this!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have never watched an interview that has pissed me off like this one..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If I were the wife I just let them be. They seem like energy suckers,I just hope she is not late. I realize that most of us were raised to say we are okay for the sake of others peace. Later on you realize it was never worth it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife is so selfish she wanted to have the baby ndo afunge Abraham mbona anajifanya vyenye Ali care na akakubali kupata boll ya bwana ya mtu cera alikubali coz she didn't had an otherwise tena huyu mwanamke anakaa Mzee cera is beautiful in and out
q4sWUJxjc4g,I envy this family...am in a polygamous family a third wife but the way the guy behaves is not good at all. He never shows you to his people and u wonder.... everything he does is secretive and he goes ahead and gives u that feeling that cowives should not meet and more over is a Muslim. Bigups Abraham thank you for showing generosity.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is very very beautiful and calm, we love you ❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes,Serah,is just a matter of time,one year you go out of the house and kick Maureen out of your house or you move on with your life without Abraham.You are giving them a lot of airtime."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen anataka kuonyesha vile anajua rusungu
q4sWUJxjc4g,ama hawa watu mi malesbian??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Myb😂😂😂🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,I remember  on Citizen TV when Maureen was asked if she could  allow Abraham  to get  a 3rd wife and she muffled  and threw the ball back to Serah. She clearly  cannot  stomach another   woman being   added after her. She knows it's painful  but it's okay for her to do it to Serah? Selfish indeed!  But Serah has an option.  She has her own skills that can give her a decent income even if she may not be able to live the life she's  living right  now. And slowly she can build  herself  up and get her own wealth.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn are you getting young🤤🤤🤤you look 16 bana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eeiish serah💓💓💓ni mrembo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is truly painful to watch.... 
I honestly don't believe Sarah is happy.
I wish them well.....cheating, polygamy....not for me.❌❌❌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My two cents is that Cerah feels inadequate thus lowering her self esteem and  has to agree with the arrangement of marriage. She could be hurting deep inside but has to cope with the reality lest she loses her ""bae. 
It sounds illogical to fail to express her emotions genuinely yet It can be  read all over the 😢face. As she gets older the story will change and she will view things from a different perspective. Her children are still small but the moment they are grown she will be free and  more independent .  I hope the reggae won't stop. 
 Maureen on the other hand lacks moral authority, she could have opted to stay away from a married   man  yet she was still young but si ni life Yao!! I won't  support the arrangement but if they say they are happy  I should  ""believe"" it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati with zero judgement ,lyne are you seriouse??no man can love two ladies the same, never"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haki pesa wewe.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what??after all what are these people trying to show the world ??nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Love is jealous and love hurts real bad.Serah/Sarah/Cera ain't a happy woman at all.She deserves much more.I have no better words for Maureen BUT God's watching. Abraham life is like grass and glass.The pain and tears,the hurtache i know and I say come back to this comment later in life YOU WILL PAY FOR EACH DROP of everything. God has his way.Goes to the others out there too."
q4sWUJxjc4g,SINIPEWE ROHO KAMA YA CERA
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is looking beautiful and younger 😍 I love the family
q4sWUJxjc4g,woooi God forbid..cera I salute u babygal😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mhhh. Moreen I don't think you are honest mara u knew he was married mara you had forgotten 🤔. Tough questioning from Lynn though. Cerah you are strong. Abraham selfish 😌
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeee nimepitaa comments Hadi  maoni yangu yamepotea😤😤 anywei all are fans
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaa mwangi umefanya ile kitu.waaa hata no.3 atakuja tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that it’s a 34 year old with 2 33 year old wives stresses my head already 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️29.30 is sad!!!! He didn’t want to lose Maurer in his life. Yet Cera is happy- How 🤷🏻‍♀️someone watch 43:07
q4sWUJxjc4g,I dont really know what to think of this show today coz for me it leaves alot to be said. So do we now advocate for men to bring along a second wife after being married for years to his first wife. Question to ask what in the first place made him want to look for a second wife. What are we teaching the children we are raising today.. that it is okay to marry a second and a third wife... i dont know whay to think no matter how good these 3 are putting it🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah deserves alot more than she is receiving.....her heart is heavy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah. Sometimes its also good to have standards kiasi.  Serah is too nice thats why these idiots took advantage of her.  Am so mad yani. I feel for serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dude don't get married if you are not ready. He is cheating and making it sound glamorous.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very nice story here I wonder why it's not trending
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks lynn.I follow you from Uganda but reality is most men are into polygamous marriages but are very smart not to be discovered. Others have a string of girlfriends and this is reality!Just live your life girls for as long as he creates family time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mental stability, HIV & STD's don't know 'as long as'"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaa even if outwardly everything is okay it looks one heart is pleading
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is it that moulin looks older than cerah...ad cerah is much prettier than her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera, one can see your deep down  pain ,u had no choice bt accept..May God give you strength"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aky comments…..wamama ghai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I pity Abraham and Maureen....Cerah, you don't have to stick to that sick marriage. You actually don't look happy. Seek God and He will show you what next."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If there's a word that's less in these conversations it's 'love' this looks more like a contract, these decisions aren't based on love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"PREMIUM! PREMIUM! PREMIUM! TEARS LOADING!😭😭😭😭MAUREEN NO MATTER HOW YOU SUGAR COAT THINGS...YOU ARE ASUNDER IN SERAH AND ABRAHAMS MARRIAGE,THE BIBLE IS CLEAR.GOD IS JUST GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO REALIZE YOUR MISTAKE.ABRAHAM YOU ARE ON GODS WEIGHING SCALE.I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THIS MAN HAVING OTHER WOMEN OUT THERE...JUST FROM HIS REMARKS HE IS SELFISH! SELFISH AND VERY SELFISH.SERAH YOU ARE HURTING BUT GOD IS WORKING OUT YOUR PAIN...VERY SELFISH OF ABRAHAM AND MAUREEN.I CANT WASTE MY TIME WATCHING THIS NONESENSE...ITS JUST ANNOYING."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am I the only one who feels that the guy doesn't love Cerah anymore? Cerah move out please please I beg you. You don't deserve that. Even the pain on her face tells it all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Btw Abraham and Cera looks great together ❤️..huyu Maureen nae but si ni life 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What I want to know is what Serah's dad has to say about this right now!

Serah stayed because of threats she would lose her kids... :("
q4sWUJxjc4g,Si alimwabia asome akakataa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sure Sera cries silently everytime Maureen and Abraham are together.....she's not okay.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Those tears are pain n since she she has never been lucky n all the luck she had was him so she has no choice! inauma sikwaubaya
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weee 🕺Ladies 🙄 kindly please marry the person who loves you , NOT the one you love,, Be where you are celebrated NOT where you are Torelated 💯💯💯💯✌️✌️✌️✌️ Meanwhile You can't serve two masters as the same time 🤷"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! so amazing i really love this family

q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! so amazing i really love this family
q4sWUJxjc4g,wooiye serah you can see clearly that I've now serah has no voice
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a unique story. What i find hypocritical about Maureen is her talking about ""respect"". She did not have it initially because she would have also ""respected"" Abraham's marriage and stayed away from him. Not to say he was right to cheat in the first place. If you love someone you wouldn't cheat, which is what he did before Sera found out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The whole mistake s abtaham's
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy irritates me lynn na si kwa ubaya n i blv iam in the same mix aki am really broken just that sijui the other lady...Alafu hio issue ya dont touch my phone i wont touch hours thats all about infidelity n lack of trust...I hate
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fuckery .Nijikute
q4sWUJxjc4g,"10mins into the interview and you can tell Abraham is one selfish man. Kwanza he made it look like the only reason he married Cerah was because she cleaned well. Like what!? I feel bad for Cerah honestly. Let's not normalize this. This is not normal, Kwanza living in the same house 🤦🏿‍♀️ And their responses sound rehearsed. I'm sure he won't stop siring children 🤦🏿‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham and Maureen are partners in crime, they both cheated on Sarah and so they cant trust each other. Did you guys also see how Cerah and Maureen looked at each other when Abraham said he is a strong Believer? 🤣. Also you Cerah, never say your weaknesses Infront of people, ""ati I have never been lucky"" shut up they will take advantage. Speak blessings to  your life, also having a man who cheats on you is not being lucky.  Cerah is beautiful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am here praying for the three.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara is so beautiful than the other one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In the other interview,,, While dating Abraham used to tell serah that he will marry two wives,,so she got in knowing that..Haroooooo.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah needs to have an exit plan. So sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata hajarashia😠😠
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looking through comments, this must be the LNS Story with the highest number of comments ever.

Life is about choices. Everyone has a right to their choice.

Kudos Abraham, you have done what most men can't do. The male species is polygamous by nature but most men have shadow families who only come to light when they die.

Congratulations for your bold step 🎊🎉🥳🎈"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He said clearly said that, at times you look beyond love, then earlier he said that Mourine was his favorite business partner that at some point prioritized his business, join the dots.
Personally I can't, not to mention living under the same roof, for Cerah she's different, even her find things out herself speaks alot.
If their husband had genuine intentions, she could have just let her know not after her finding out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Isn't this condoning and encouraging polygamy? Contradicting GOD...very sad only.
Kenyans, as you make your bed, so must you lie in it....enjoy the new constitution!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wanawake SI man chuki🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 . But my lovely wive mimi sikuletei mwingine usiconfuse hii message  ngome njaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am reading comments and one question keeps popping on my mind,isn't this a reality to many women? Anyway to each his own,
No judgement over here,
Thank you  Lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Mwangi is a wise guy on womens desperation of mrg.even now no ring to keep others away.if ur dad had ur mum only..why marry 2.kukuta skuma you liked her heels n financial stability..then for money again you met Maureen n married her...ooh Lord Jesus Christ intervene for the ladies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am in an Arab countries where husband have 4 wives  in the same house 😊😊 kubalanciwa ndio challenge kidogo
q4sWUJxjc4g,My God! ati moods! I can’t have the time to deal with mood swings from a woman who has decided to intrude my private life! No woman of substance will agree to this kind of an arrangement.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is Betrayal from Abraham,,if he thinks he did the right thing he is Wrong ... Sarah has no otherwise"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men are scarce  but ladies are alot, this is githeri style zoea au ona mlango system"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is naturally beautiful in and out ❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife's even if they welcome you   they always pretend only that they don't have otherwise I am a witness  .
q4sWUJxjc4g,I Kno you are trying to be politically correct but Maureen is naturally beautiful too. Rangi ya Thao 🤸🏼‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this should be a life experience, Cerah may god bless you together with your family i view you as the head of the family despite Abraham, he is such a brave and caring husband, i won't drop this pen without acknowledging Maureen she is soo understanding and respectful, i think she is well raised, the respect she has for Mam Cerah, African ladies stop fighting and insulting (gossip) one another this is a good example one should learn from,  i am happy for this family. All the best"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think I am one of the few people who follow their channel and see no problem with their set up. It is their marriage, Cera has said she has no issue with it. It seems to be working out well for them. People will criticize but at the end of the day, they are the ones in the marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ooh my God jameni hii story nitamu
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless you Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,why is this guy interjecting serah whenever she is speaking...? n when morin is speaking he is super silent or he afraid Serah anaeza choma
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy deserve to be honored with that HSC title by president.its true nothing is impossible 😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,akh I love you u Lynn u are the best ever❤❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everything is trustworthy...and everything will just flow by it self...am just asking myself what if this happens to me can I be this kind🤔 happiness and love wins
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is not from God Abraham, therefore don't include God in your adultery act."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mauano joined, I came in peace ✌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Having two wives, i have no comment, coz its a personal decision though it involves other people (wives and their families), but i seem to have a problem with Maureen, she is encouraging other women to be second wives and she seem not concerned with how the first wife feels. if it happenned to her and because she has Cerah with a big heart, it doesn't mean, thats what all the other women are. if the husband is to get the third wife, sh will be the first to complain. sorry to Cerah, coz she sacrificed her happiness for the family. 

thank you Lynn for the show. i am a man and its an eye opener"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah seems soo cold. for 36minutes she has only spoken for 1 or less minute.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh Nkosi'Yami these children really shocked me the core considering their line of ages by the look of my eyes, they're the in the same age lines with my own children but shockingly they have strong and huge hearts to take this high ladder. Well was common by the times of our mother's and grandparents but now these children are trying to show us that what was started by our forefathers is not suppose to die but a legacy that has to remain and live on because it has been transmitted by our ancestors or predecessor. I salute you guys you've open the eyes of many, talking from my own point of view as an adult, it will stop or minimise / reduce the undesirable to the smallest possible amount of degree. Good job guys & Happy Family Wishes👏❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Watching from South Africa , language barrier😭😭😭💔am giving up on this video though looks interesting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The bible says ""you cannot serve two masters,  as you will love one more and despise the other"". This relationship is a time bomb in waiting. This marriage is formed out of deceit, infidelity and selfishness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,As anyone noticed how Abraham interrupts cerah in the name of lemmi help you out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy met his wife when he was already married
q4sWUJxjc4g,Whats the big deal it's one man with 2 wifes my grandfather  had 6
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu Abraham ana tamaa atoa mwingine tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kwani nko nchi nyingine
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ulisahau kuuliza?How did parents from the 3 sides react to this matter?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I personally don’t understand how this is an inspiring story 
Fact is love isn’t a feeling , it’s a choice and it’s values . That warm flame in our hearts dies out in time that is just life but you have choose to honor and respect your partner 

Those who believe Maureen and Abraham are in love let’s revisit after 5 years after all that warmth is over . 

This guy will fall in love with someone else after the goo with Maureen is over, wait and see. Also, Maureen looks old 🤷🏽‍♀️

Also, Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree she looks old. I guess it comes with the weight of ruining someone else's happiness. This man will eventually get tired of her though.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After God, fear men!  how can one person love 2 women? if it were me i would seriously move out, riches or no riches, this is trash!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The 1st wife is very beautiful. Serah anaonekana  mhumble sana...ata haongei sana kama 2nd wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not a wonder a third wife is introduced . And the same  line is used . ""I love you thrice""😂. Y'all mine it's won't a wonder"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife honestly is beautiful 💙❤️💟🤍🤍🤍💟💙❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is soo gorgeous
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true 🥰in and out
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Beautiful Waceera you don't deserve this😢, i can't"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well, I guess Abraham is a bit insensitive to Cerah. Its a bit of a sad state and living with the situation."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When Abraham and Sarah were all alone, if maybe Sarah asked him if he would marry a second wife, he could definitely say no but he did it. Now that he has two, there are high chances of having the third one even more. Asidanganye hapa and maybe  in the next few years tutamuona na mwingine."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What kind of a Woman is Cera?..I think she has a heart that is on another level..THIS FAMILY IS STANDING BECAUSE OF HER..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's only if we understand spiritually what polygamus altars do to families.... You will run for your dear life..There's no happiness ask Hanna n Peninah, ask Sarah n hagai, ask Rechael n Leah... Solomon the man of great wisdom ended up writing eclesiastes n proverbs n ended up serving the gods of Baal... Polygamus altars they reduce heros  to zeros n creates way for witchcraft to dominate.... The battle their children will have to fight to bring this altars down only God will have mercy..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,If my husband bring another lady in my house. .I will work slowly n live them enjoy there life I can't die in side my heart when am seee..... 🏃🏃🏃 my God open us eyes 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This confirms that personality is key in relationships. Take your time to know a person's personality if it blends with yours. Both are beautiful women but have different personalities and the man loves the first lady but connects more with the secord lady. Regardless he did good not abandoning his first wife. As long as they respect each other they can survive, as it is a reality they cannot run from."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lucy Wambui please know that what is going on here is displeasing to God. Personality or not they are committing adultery, except for the graceful Sarah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only personality trait here is multiple personality from Sarah who is pretending and faking to be happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy took advantage of first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,A man who keeps on saying OH Shit!???🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmmh this one kuna  mwenye anatumika  tu💔💔 normal  women can't  allow  this😪😪
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is so beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy does not even look like a real man   ...he looks so gay face expectations tells alot maybe he was trying to run away from his wife and got caught in another 🙂this ladies deserve better am sure if Serah walks away the other lady will not cope for long
q4sWUJxjc4g,jamaa anaenjoy threesome
q4sWUJxjc4g,"two is company, three is a crowd"
q4sWUJxjc4g,' 2+2=4 ' that the reality of mathematics but what if I tell you ' 2+2=5 '. You will try to prove me wrong and yes mathematically am wrong but in my mind am right. No matter what you do you will never understand why the 1 is omitted from the equation but included in the answer. Until you understand the phenomenon behind the ' 1' you will never understand situations like the above.
q4sWUJxjc4g,But its true ur a destroyer (on a light note) ...no woman feels good sharing his man out there
q4sWUJxjc4g,My opinion Abraham is so mean and self centered.He kept moreen to keep the business moving and serah bcoz she is a wife material and she stood with him from far.sarah deserves the best I don't support this lynnn.let him build for moreen Love is jealous
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen you are  cursed and this will follow your  kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera you deserve  better dear...open your  eyes ...he doesn't  love  you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its all ok, i just wonder what makes the man feel so secure coz we both know once women get together.... 🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ladies you deserve  more than that fool
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I dont see anything that can justfy this, the so what they are calling friendship,  taking care of each other bra bra....may be those are what they could call coping mechamism.  We dont need second wifes for such. Maureen pls respect Serahs marriage and let her be, and even if it were to be dont you think the man should get you your own empire? Trust me if one day things go wrong you will realise the intruder you are... you will literally be thrown out. Respect yourself too."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"have followed this story keenly and what have loved about these people,is how they have handled this situation.A man can have one wife but the home is like a hell..the best choice on this earth is peace of mind and happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love Lynn  interviews, you really feel and Vibe with the whole story,she is very intelligent on the whole story process and she knows the questions to ask . Abrahams family just like watching your channel keep it up"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful couples yes better be in a polygamous marriage than be public property
q4sWUJxjc4g,Better be single
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is madness !! I see two selfish grown ups who don't care about cera's feelings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My dear Serah, I hope God gives you strength to walk out of this mess! There’s no love here. You are beautiful and deserve better. Trust me, you are better off without him."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Dear Serah,
That man does not deserve you,contrary to what you may believe...you deserve better...he said he does not even spend time with you like he does the second woman...may greatest prayer for you is that God may give you the courage to make the right decision not only for you but also your children..you may not see it now but later on you may see the impact of it in your children...you can pick things from even the tiniest of comments..like when he was asked what he liked about you when he first saw you and he gave a very vague answer...please don't sacrifice your worth for someone else's selfish desire..you are worth much more than this🥰"

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a very young man for such.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Sera, do you really believe that you're capable of standing on your own and even attract another man if you desire it?? 🤔 If only you'd fully love and believe in yourself...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is unacceptable to me. Never in my life. If am not enough for you, then I give you space."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is unacceptable to me. Never in my life. If am not enough for you, then I give you space."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When Abraham told her ""I have a child with Maureen and I'm not leaving her"" spoke a bunch about the decision that he had already made. That guy had already decided that Maureen is the deal hatakama cera ataenda. This is not right in all aspects, she is probably there just to cover up the shame of being a single mother and knowing how much effort she had made to bring this guy to the level of his success."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have a child with Maureen blablabla. That was a pregnant statement. It was take it or leave it. And you stayed. To him that was desperate.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaaa this where we are .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera Hiyo si bahati he chose  moreen over you pray God to bless you with your own man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"WAIT,,,,DID MAUREEN SAY CERAH ALIFIKA PLACE AKAZOEA??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is pure nonsense,when you entertain crap,chill for more and don't regret! Serah get a life...you are the oppressed here."
q4sWUJxjc4g,hii couple kuna uongo tu...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham Abraham father of faith_ nation 💕 may the peace of God be with your family.its easy have two family's together Love with the of Christ......
q4sWUJxjc4g,SERAH IS HURTING!!!!SHE NEED RESCUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,A big no for me
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The benefit of this relationship is only one. That all of the kids have their father's presence in equal measure. 
Maybe that's what Cera was afraid of; her kids competing for the attention of their dad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wwuuueh...okay
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hope that serah awakens, heals, aligns, detoxifies and gets her power back. be strong enough to walk out of this BS. she tolerated the period of the manz keeping a side chick mpaka akaletewa kwa nyumba? queen you are not okay. you are too good for this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Sarah as a single lady nimejifunza kuolewa na mtu wa my class if am form 4 leaver let him be form 4 leaver cz it's like Abraham alipenda Maureen bcoz wako the same class poor sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Luck of knowledge and wisdom
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If tables were turned, am sure the man would not even spend another day with Sera if she was the one with another man. This is just absurd."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The problem is this guy will bring the third woman and that’s when the trouble will start
Man never gets satisfied, he will see another beautiful woman and would want her to join the family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Two wives one will be a witch
q4sWUJxjc4g,Out of the word of God
q4sWUJxjc4g,The audacity in this man 🚮🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where can I get such a heart 🤣🤣😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have struggled to watch this.i dont know why🙆🙆
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy is so proud and stiupid
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This story aki !!! my heart goes to sera as much as the says she is ok. and wait ......she said she is comfortable but did not confirm that she is happy when Lynn asked.  you have a big heart mama. but father Abraham though seems to be so much into Maureen everything seemed to revolve around her......needs to be protected.........behaved so well to make this work........ bla bla bla and when proclaiming his love for them he was just looking at maureen....cheei ! if it was not for sera I don't think there would be peace in that marriage arrangement, the two owe her and yes she ought be appreciated more especially by Abraham. she even deserves to be taken for dates now that 'baba' spends all day with maureen......and maureen's responses though,  yeah, she seems to feel guilty so far! however, to each their own, may you all find yourselves........and true hapiness. .....PESA WEWE..... nie maa......ndingehota!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have not watched this to the end , imeni bore! This guy and Morin irk me. How dare they? Alafu how is this Morin trying to fool everyone? Ati how is your wife? Why are you doing him na unajua ako na bibi? Aki nimekasirika ata. Ceera is a very strong woman though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This family set up would last longer without involving social media... the comments will make one of them to walk away sana sana Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu Abraham ata hapei cerah chance aongee.I think thats how he and maureen domimate over her. Maureen ungetafuta your own husband and Abraham you betrayed cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cannot see how Maureen held on to someone else’s husband. You  stole someone else’s affection; God hates that.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Which god….
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I Say To You All That We Do Not Have The Luxury Of Time As Many Suppose, That At Any Given Time You Could Transition Into Eternity. The Question Is, Do You Have Your Eternal Destiny Secured In JESUS CHRIST? Is Your Name Recorded In The Book Of Life? For What Does It Profit A Man To Gain The Whole World & Forfeit His Own Soul. Do Not Ignore This!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can never support this..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Allah God new men from beginning and HE new single lady won't be enough to a man and that's why God make them to have 4 women and bcos you Christian they can't share man that's why you end up having a man coming home late bcos of mpango wa kando.talk to him give him freedom let him bring his kimanda home
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs for Serah, i hope one day you realise you deserve better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Clearly this is just about the guy, women:
; we need empowerment especially financial freedom"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a manipulator goshiiii
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My paternal grandfather had 8 wives, on my mums side had 2 wives,
My dad again had 2 wives,
Hehehe there's nothing good in polygamy 😅😅,am choosing cooperating over having a cowife,
There are always endless fights"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a narcissist, I don't but Serah's acceptance no not at all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is somehow madness, you can't stay with two wives in the same house. This man has failed  to take care of two families.  Men get married to many wives but they built separate houses for them. Respect your first wife by letting her stay in her own house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But remember serah suggested that.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is  kind of first wife being defensive yet the husband has shown her she's not complete the first wife's should let the second and even third  to leave separate house even at a far place but wapi  they see that  they will inherit everything which is not the case
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would only do this if I’m Bisexual so that I can also enjoy his side chic period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@trizahnjeru1212 she is more than complete, it's him who is a bastard."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can see sadness in Sarah’s face
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true. She is sad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart bleeds for Serah. She is hiding alot of pain. Maureen is selfish. Would she do the same if she was Serah?
q4sWUJxjc4g,So Mr Abu here claims Sarah is a whole package and still brought Maureen into the picture. Men😂🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is painful to watch :( 😞.  Haki Cera looks so hurt,keeps saying 'by the grace of God she had to accept..kwanza the way he pursued Maureen.  Hii it aisha in premium tears 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is such a smooth operator..
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy comes out as arrogant and his got a lot of pride.He has other side chicks out there you can’t take this to the bank.Him claiming his happy with 2 wives it’s just a show.What is the other lady that came in providing that the 1st wife wasn’t since they are even living in the same house.His just mannerless.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I never comment, but today I will. 

Most of us beautiful ladies have been approached by married men, some we knew and some we didn’t. Some we even had “feelings” (this is not love but infatuation) for, but immediately we knew they were married, we made a CHOICE to leave these men and completely cut off communication. We made a CHOICE because we never wanted to build our happiness on another woman’s tears(I am sure Cera cried, and those tears will sure be repaid, it is the law of nature and nature will make it happen) 

The word is  “CHOICE!!!!” …Maureen should have done exactly that. 

I hope Cera will value herself and leave until this guy comes back to sanity, or Maureen will leave this marriage in peace because she really intruded. If not so, this guy will cheat again and again. It may not be today or tomorrow, but he will. He needs deliverance. I am very sure there are people who just had a burden to cry to God about this marriage, Maureen is not safe, even if Cera decides to leave. 

Anyone can Sugarcoat it as they want, but Maureen and Abraham are still committing adultery."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are committing adultery right inside the house of Cera but she had no choice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its really unfortunate
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This interview has showed how Serah is hurting, hugs girl. Seems she didn't have a choice than to accept the second one sadly"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The moment Lynn asked the second one why she stopped telling the guy to go home and opened up to him to an extent of having a baby, weeeh she was tongue tied."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True😉
q4sWUJxjc4g,True😉
q4sWUJxjc4g,Trueeee😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,True 😄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After following their story, solution parents is empower your girls. Let them acquire an education and a career"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People jokingly say""you meet your soul mate after you get married"",.Abraham seems to love Maureen more...Serah may God give you grace,wisdom,coz this is so weird"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah insisted she is ok. For now! 

Maureen, Abraham is still defending you online but forgot to console Serah. We are here to console Serah. She is there till the children grow. Serah is making sure you don’t take her children’s father away from them. She is a wise woman. But you Maureen are foolish to expect acceptance. For what good? It will never be well with you and your conscience. You find a woman in her house and expect praises surely? You got pregnant knowing very well that he was married. You will live with the pain you have caused Serah. Malipo ni hapa hapa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even by the look of things serah is not comfortable and Abraham is in favour of Maureen ,personally I wouldn't put up with this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel like this guy is a closeted narcissist....selfish!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Plainly speaking, I’m married, I new lady shows up being all nice yet screwing my hubby halafu calls me a friend 😳earth is hard."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moureen, you are very weak and selfish infact you are in the wrong marriage. And for Abraham someone should tell you that what you are doing is pure madness! Don't be too confident! It will bite you in no time"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is wrong on every level.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata mahari hajalia🙄...father Abraham???
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its good moreen you discovered you came to an establishment home.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What award is Serah worth!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is BS, I give you 5 years tuone mutakua wapi."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You should all stop .....judging MAUREEEN...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Alafu mnatuabia tutafute mtu hana Mali tutafute pamoja---------,na hamtuabii huyo mwanaume akipata Mali itakuwaje???.Cera started with the guy when he was working in the grocery alafu akaanza company yake and cera was no longer enough.Young ladies--wakeup"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham please you broke the heart of the wife of your youth...she had no choice I wish you treasured her.She would make you another Barrack Obama...you lost blessings....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are they twins coz they look alike?
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can't serve two masters one must wait 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki mapenzi wewe🤔love you guys 🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,"so that's how the relationship began it started as a secret from serah then they come and justify here it was love, he still went ahead and hid from Maureen when he had a kid anyway one person is just benefiting from this marriage.Anyway for such stories its too early to tell what will happen in the future. he is smooth vile anaongea hehehe there are some people who are blessed with the talent of finding good people and  using them to their advantage. Being good and accommodating wount earn u a first class ticket to heaven. why was their so much secrecy? only when serah asked about it ndo aliconfess? I am not seeing any remorse and genuineness from this story nkt....God he just gave her  an ultimatum if thats not an accept of power and control i dont know what is??? akuna equal love apa....She would have left angemsupport tu this is madness what if the guy wants another wife when does it come to an end?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,People got nerves 😳!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Churches and the govt should come up and protect innocent women from such selfish men. There should be a fine for emotional damages before you separate with such selfish men! The society should also not sugar coat infidelity! And to homewreckers they should also be fined .
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Man! Such disrespect to his wife! Surely Cerah is too good for this clawn.  She should walk out and let these two co continue their circus.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's immoral,  let's  not pretend, call wrong wrong.  What are they teaching/showing  their children? the second woman, girl you should just leave and trust GOD to give you your own husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah knew this guy is narcissist, not well groomed so she had no choice but to accept this for the sake of her kids but she is in pain and unhappy. Sarah feels betrayed, Moreen feels cheap but both caught in a situation or a liar, heartless, not groomed and immoral guy who is chassing women around for material interests. this kind of disrespect, narcissism and manipulation towards women should be addressed."
q4sWUJxjc4g,These two cheating idiots are literally holding Serah hostage in this whole arrangement.  Serah truly loved this man but thos man is a cheating bastard who brought his mistakes to the house.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah ran for your life! This is not what God intended for marriage! Lets not envourage infidelity! And to the other woman , you are a homewrecker!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can never be me.  Sarah is the loser in all this. Ni kuvumilia tu. But y’all do you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Life is about choices, if you choose to be a second or third wife go for it. If you decide to remain single and date multiple men that is upto you. Pilipili usiyoila yakuwashia nini."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah....my mum is in her late 50s and can never accept this Bellshill!!!!!! Why would u????? Gal u r  worth a lot more n there r men who wud adore u alone. I don't know ua story but from a professional perspective, u need to soul search.  Mwangi bro u seem u b the kind of guy who gets trapped easily.  Sarah...by t h e way hakuna shida haiwezi kufixiwa... medicine has really progressed. God bless u Sarah. Meangi n Maureen... God will judge u....big time for sure...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am in a polygamous arrangement my heart goes for serah ...hope u find happiness like maureen ...i truly dont see it.♥️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I always prefer watching  but not put a comment.  But today I have to..... this is the most awful  thing I have even seen. Uuuummmm how do you even stay in one house sharing a man? If I was Serah I would have  left the two bugers. Women need to set their boundaries 
I found it so disrespecting 😤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,To my future husband kindly don't try this at home...if you need two ladies in your house marry us the same day .. usiniletee mtu kwa mulango 🥴🥴🥴🥴 I don't share
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah!!! God knows the best.. Just be patient 🙏Moureen I can see the Love you have for Sarah 🙏😇 for the husband not sure what to say..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I do believe in calling a spade a spade! Enyewe Mwangi hapa was a classic case of a cheat beautified! Maureen also played part in breaking a marriage! No matter what you say, Mwangi for real just trying to justifying, Serah was forced to settle, she loved she did not have a choice! Maureen a home wrecker she slithered ! You girls keep talking about watoto! How about Serah! She was broken!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so beautiful Sarah had to agree and accept the husband’s needs/extramarital affair but she did it with grace. However in the scope of things she is a smart woman. Women are powerful in their own way. You can make anything/ any situation work.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like your intro music.
I pray for continue happiness to this Happy family.
hope Abraham will continue to show love to you guys.
please don't go for third wife. Maintain this your beautiful wives"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When I read the caption, I thought the two women agreed to marry same man right from the start. I never knew it was a case of adultery and inflicting pan on someone else. I'm so pissed with Abraham and Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is pure nonsense. What is this man tapping about. You are simply an adulterer! I'm disappointed in Maureen. You stole another woman's husband. Period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When Maureen says ""you are the best husband anyone will ever want to have"" she failed terribly. Who will ever want the kind of the man in her life? Maybe all home wreckers like her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn at that moment ya 3 some hug... Hug ukuta!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly! that Maureen of a lady has a heart of stone
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen  leave marriage ya wachera go and get you own husband   will be ok if that guy bring third wife  he is not a wise man  why did he betrayed his beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@lucygikonyo2437 bt the man seems to love Maureen sana,he will follow her too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Time is a fair judge..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you would have made it in your own way.. you dint have to go through this coz you have kids..this other lady had an option of staying away and getting someone else to marry her.. this guy is too full of himself.  Serah you just have to believe in yourself
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves Maureen more
q4sWUJxjc4g,Once a cheater always a cheater!!!! Sara is still hurting. TOXIC!!!!!!!!!!

q4sWUJxjc4g,"May thunder strike this idiot of a man. And seraph, you're third wheeling. The way Abraam and Moreen are gisting while Sera is in the middle, woi... This is the highest bs I've listened to."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its so achievable when you have the second who is so mature and not a 22 year old baby who disrespects the first wife and she is like am here and there’s nothing you can do .. that’s where men go wrong… bringing in a cheap small girl .. but when  the man brings in a mature woman it’s all good
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These children will grow up traumatized, polygamy was allowed by traditions but not in the same house.
Cera doesn't look happy as she claim.. She kept sayi3 ""aki mapenzi wewe""... I wish she can establish her business and go to work, have her own things. This is crazy.
My opinion tho."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To each their own. 
Thank you Lynn for sharing this. 
I thank God for my dad bringing us up in Church and In one stable family 👪.  I honour him even more. May I continue in My fathers steps and Love my one and only woman faithfully , God bless every man that is doing his best in his knowledge and wisdom from God. 
Proverbs 15:20"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sasa hii ni sister wives Kenyan version ama?
By the way Christine walked out on Cody for lack of affection. Christine got a voice and that was when Cody realised he couldn’t tame her!

I feel Lynn was hypocritical in this coverage this is why; Couple of days ago/a week maybe Lynne covered a very heartbreaking story of a woman who was in an extremely abusive marriage, Lynn cried with her, supported her, she felt safe in Lynn’s environment. 
In the coverage the lady persistently mentioned the ex husband’s mpango wa kando. The lady’s story led to Lynn even promised to host special show for people in abusive marriages. 

Afew days later Lynne covers a very controversial story (Abraham et al. Story). In this story even though no apparent signs of physical abuse can be seen, clearly everything on this episode is faked. Abraham is controlling the narrative, he is ready to jump in when he realises that Lynn is going deep ( he manages to curl Lynn into his corner, Lynn not to ask questions that can expose his emotional abuse, he successfully curls Lynn) 
Abraham manages Cera’s narrative he is very attentive to ensure Cera doesn’t give any controversies. 
Once again he shows selfish tendencies and this time he doesn’t sacrifice his daughter by deleting her photos on WhatsApp because of mpango wa kando and inhumanely allowing his daughter to know about his other baby mama. Abraham is sacrificing Cera on Lynn’s show to defend Maureen from online attacks. Bottom line Cera is being use. 
Once again Cera doesn’t comprehend that she is being used.
Lynn on the other hand shows a complete change of tone to Abraham et al. Lynn insists not to judge Abraham whereas the emotional abuse is so clear and apparent. 

Cera should never have been put in the position whereby Abraham was going to use her image on the show to defend Maureen. On the other hand Lynn body language should not have been of happiness and excitement hosting Abraham and even urging people not to judge, if truly Lynn stands up to domestic violence/abuse. All that this does is extend the abuse. 
Emotional abuse is dangerous than physical abuse. Emotional abuse is addictive. Cera is not able to realise the emotional abuse because she is addicted to it and doesn’t know how to live without it.
Whereas Maureen and Abraham are definitely using every opportunity they can get to explore opportunities at hand."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"This woman called Maureen is talking nonesense only with alot of shame allover her face, my opinion but s she is a homebreaker, husband snatcher, without manners"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 Sending loads of 🤗 to you Serah, you were never enough for him and you will never be."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man didn't love cera.and still this man clearly is more affectionate to the other who I don't like much since she knew this man had a family and still went ahead and bore him a child.cera is beautiful inside and outside and a keeper and the man knows this. And why does he keep on interrupting her,Cera is still paining,tries so much to hide but it shows. who am I to judge."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen una ufala  sana.  After getting  jis baby  u didn't  have to move in their  house  and get  married. Ungebaki  baby mama  like  yvette  and bahati.  Mbaki  coparents  like corazon  and frankie.  Ataowa  tu  wa  number 3.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story is so disgusting.  I know sera personally  hata i cannot finish watching.  Really bad. Nkt!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,The way he is licking his lips is annoying. Cerah... Take heart.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is in pain. This is clearly shown in her facial expressions. I feel the pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is so domineering in the marriage. I pity Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn nakupenda
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What positive impact does this whole story have surely,so sad to watch.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is never funny, my dear lord lemme never get subjected in a such kind of life, and for you serah you ailing inside your heart but I hope you come to heal one day,what an emotional damage🥲!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can love two people but never on the same level!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yh
q4sWUJxjc4g,With all due respect polygamy is a no!  Is this Biblical? Just wondering 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cheating on your wife is ADULTERY
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't accept to go for an interview.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The third one is coming soon
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is just an amazing woman....
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would love to hear from them 2-3yrs to come......for now no comment
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men are selfish shame🙌
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful couples God bless you Maureen N Sarah leave Long N love flows in your home Abraham take care of these Queens.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First of all the guy is not done with women, again anakaa gay alafu what's the moral story of this video?
Damn lyn I thought you were better than this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah if I were you I would choose peace, sanity has to come first, your mental health is everything, to hell with his money 💰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She even looks older than Serah😡😡😡Toka kwa ndoa ya mwenzako chokeee
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ask the ladies if they will accept a 3rd wife bcos Abraham will definitely expand his polygamous realm.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is clearly not happy, just saying as a woman who understands  what is not spoken"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, why would you ask if that is God's doing. God does not endorsed this lifestyle.  Stop using the Bible to condone your  immoral behavior."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And how is it immoral behaviour if it’s not for the bible. You too are using that book.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This helps to stop kids from being produced kids out of wedlock. I support this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,he will not stop cheating trust me. and by the time he is 50 he will have several children out there.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What? This is whitewashing a tomb….
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Maureen was the first wife hangeitikia Sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woi Sarah accepted this for the sake of seeing his husband every night..she knew Maureen akiwa her hubby atakuwa hapo all the time 
But she is pretending she is OK but she is not."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This two women are wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mbona when serah start s talking kicheko inaangushshwa
q4sWUJxjc4g,who else notices that Abraham keeps on looking at the second wife more when he is addressing sth...for example when he said i love u he was not looking at Sarah but at Maureen his second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eh😱
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen a day shall come wen yu shall pay dearly for what yu did to Sarah.yu cnt seat there and pretend is normal.is not normal is a sin..kwendaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"at times we forget that its Grace that keeps us moving not knowing too much than the message carrier we concentrate on others pple rabbit while we have our elephant to carry they brought out their story that we didn't know now we are here bringing our void choices , and comments, judgement  is from God if our blood cant cleanse what we know so much, respect their choice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don't pretend serah, no woman would love to share her man. Simple question... would you wish your daughter get married as a second wife? No matter what, don't justify things.. would you stand a third wife?. It's your business anyway..but I can see pretence"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man has self esteem issues. He is trying to fill a gap. From a man’s point of view.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Monogamy is not synonymous with happiness. Suffering & pain is inevitable whether you're in monogamy/polygamous relationship. I'd choose RESPECT any day. LOVE is overrated. This man is offering financial security for their children. Mapenzi achana nayo!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is not comfortable even in this interview..
What pains me.is the man was not afraid of loosing cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wenye tuko hapa kusupport Sarah our tent is blue one.  Hugs to our own mum
q4sWUJxjc4g,Man if you are true man of God or woman of God you should not do this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfishness!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham queens indeed.i have never heard a palace with more than one queen.The betrayal is real from the husband.Abraham is full of himself.why should a lady lower her value to accommodate a man's selfishness?Yaani after 5 years in marriage he was busy looking for another wife?..Nkt..Serah is the wife,Maureen is Abrahamas soulmate"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Haki i think am too jelous i wouldn't imagine him spending with another woman then next day with me
They must be patient enough to accept this
All the best to them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weeeh this is hard Gai,hapana."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This maureen lady she was wrong wrong from the begining just wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men ! Men!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is not a wife!  She's a  .....
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is totally unacceptable and ungodly.How would the 2nd wife feel if her husband was seeing another woman.Maureen what you have done is evil and it shall never be well with you.No matter how you put it what you are doing is wrong.Be careful cos your children might go thru what you put Sarah through.The moment you knew Abraham is marrid ungewacha hiyo relationship.Which church is it that you go to that does not rebuke sexual immorality?You waited untill mali imetengezwa then you came to eat.God will never torgibe you so long as you are im another person's marriage.Unless you come out the kingdom of God is not for you.Serah may God help you out of there.Maureen thats wickedness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you should be ashamed of yourself.  Getting involved with another woman's husband. 
Looking at Sarah, she looks like she's in pain and is only putting up with the situation for her husband. 
This is immorality to the highest.  
God help us!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah she's not that much okay, but because of love he has to the man,ilibidi aitikie"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is just bizarre 🤔 😳 but 3rd world war in that home is just around the corner.  Hiki kiburukenge cha mwanaume kitaleta bibi wa tatu. That is not God's doing its Abrahams immorality and selfishness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah honestly loves this man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah was taken in coz of the cleanliness n being tidy but he trully loves moh...my heart weeps for serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My wife can't bare this,atachoma nyumba"
q4sWUJxjc4g,They need to start there YouTube channel it will be interesting
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me I think Sarah was so much in love unlike Abraham 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kenyans wapi support ya first wife kwa hio business Yuko nayo,God loves broken hearts,God is about to do something trust this process,things will turn around for you , breakthrough is coming"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think you can love two or more people but for different reasons.....I don't see anything wrong with polygamy if no one is suffering or oppressed in the relationship......
But living together 👀👀.... that requires a special kind of grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Be ready for number 3,4 and so on si amesema anapenda light skin na wako wengi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Obviously he took Maureen out of friendship and Serah had no choice but to accept the status quo!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wishing you a wonderful a wonderful family life. It doesn’t matter what they say I’ve seen love in that family. Serah your love is immeasurable, it’s thanks to your profound love that your husband and Maureen are at peace. You planted thé seed of love and so shall you harvest love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,she'd have still planted the seed of love from a distance by  loving herself more and not letting another woman in her home...
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder if the roles were reversed whether Maureen would have accommodated Serah considering she’s even more beautiful!!  Having said this…be ready both of you to fight another woman in his midlife!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who else noticed the thumbnail....Serah seems out of this aki..the way the other two look at each other says alot
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah Mungu akubariki na ainue watoto wako that they will never go through such a thing Maureen and Abraham you are selfish and you will pay for the pain you caused this girl shame on you!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I choose Serah. Mama you are one in a million. The second woman is just a home breaker. This man doesn’t care about you and your feelings. This woman has taken away your happiness she will pay for what she has done to you in her own way. Abraham is a selfish man binding in the name of my kids. Everyone deserves to be happy this is not about the kids only but for you Serah. God got you sweet mama you deserve something better than this man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that Maureen is talking too much shows how empowered she has been by Abraham...how can you go for coffee dates with someones husband knowing so well his intentions,go ahead get a baby and still say you minded about the wife???????????????????????????NO WAY . I have ever been in such situation and what i did was to demand nijue wife,we became friends and the man had to withdraw haha so Maureen we can only see how disrespectful you were. Anywho God is always just. Nihayo tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first problem was moving in before Moreen came-life decisions-life is a sum total of all your decisions! Everyone is to blame!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is greed,  selfishness and self centeredness of its kind ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't like how Lyn is referring to Maurine..😅 baby girl..Cerah is the baby girl,so calm with a beautiful baby face 👀"
q4sWUJxjc4g,this people are happier than many one wife marriages out here...but many jealous women out here who wish they arent happy convincing their minds they arent
q4sWUJxjc4g,If i become serah today nikuzonga kaa ambulance hio sio marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,OMG! I am perplexed ...Sarah is among of those good and too nice women that people tend to use and abuse at the same. May your innocence gets you out of this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn has asked every question I would!!!! great interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can a woman agree to move in with a married man...morine you are destroyer no body who is judging you.thats it..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let them live separately
q4sWUJxjc4g,So.sooo soon you'll be meeting another ohh good and best one
q4sWUJxjc4g,No man can love 2pple i just pity Sarah just look at her she's not happy but pretending to be
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bibi wa pili anasifiwa wee wacha tu ......
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you cannot love two women at the same time but if you do please chose the second one because if you loved the first one you could not have gotten the second one, mimi hii siwezi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The Cerah we watched in Metha ya Kagoni and the Cerah here are two different people and character. Its like she had been intimidated, forced, coerced or which words do i use here she is agreeing with everything said to an extent of saying she is working yet last interview she said she is a housewife.. Ukweli tu usemwe this lady is being used and she is not happy at all na inakaa alikumbali juu ya kukosa otherwise"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Feel like I just watched a bad episode of sister wives....wondering if there will be a 3rd upgrade based on this interview.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man will still marry even upto the 10th wife what a sad story my feelings goes to Cerra
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am hearting all through.why give birth.as mpango wa kando?.to heart sera.when The deal is too good think twice.sera wake up.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is legal in Kenya. People are reacting as if the guy has committed treason. Besides, we've been practicing it for centuries as Africans."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God hates polygamy. It's wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can he atleast have two houses?
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Jewel0612 that could be the only problem with this arrangement
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In india  women marry many husbands....but no man should be shamed for saying ""this isnt for me"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Jewel0612 That's them . We have our own way life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Problem with this type of man here is that he will not stop looking. No.3 is on the way 🤦
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haki Maureen Wewe. God is watching
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Bi mkubwa anaonyesha ana maumivu moyon
Bi mdogo anjichekelesha hovyo tu😏😏😏😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife is so beautiful..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see pain all over Serah's body. There is no excuse for immorality no matter how we sugar coat it. I feel that she has been cohearsed to do whatever she is doing. For me it's a no. I can't stay with another woman in the same house. Let him build her her own house. Please God empower women so that they don't lower their standards.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even kitambo where (in some cultures) the first woman would ask the husband to get a second wife wasaidiane, the second wife would get her own home!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen akanyage nje. In the same house it's a big no. Cerah bado akona pain but she is trying to cover everything up that she is ok but by her look it can tell it all...Maureen is a homebreaker
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@marykata416 ghai maisha ni yao na wako poa na watu hawafanani
q4sWUJxjc4g,As He speaks I don't think this guy love cerah.You can see his explanation  any time he's talking about  Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@nimohenry8690 his expression
q4sWUJxjc4g,wueeeh! ile emoji ilitoka by the way juu wueeh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even God is a jealous God. Eeh itakua ngumu
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for sarah.kuna vyenye Sarah is not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like the love and unity in this young family. People will always throw stones but be strong. I support you. You look amazing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are not supporting polygamy but bare in mind prophecy must be fulfilled. Whereby it stated clearly that a time will come 7 ladies will go after one man and this must come to pass.otherqise have just loved IBRAHIM is empire
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy has confessed he has a problem. He will bring in the third wife so long as she will be light skin!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Seriously sera shld come to the comment section and see how much people love and feel for her . Lady you deserve so much more than dat prayers for you to understand that you blessed and there is someone waiting on you 💃🏾All the best Sera you blessed and stay happy 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you love two people at the same time....
Choose the second one...
Because if you truly loved the first one...
You wouldn't have fallen for the second 😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@ Faith. This doesn't apply to men. Their  third leg doesn't obey the laws of love.😑
q4sWUJxjc4g,men only reason with their tails 🤦🤦
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men cheat for lust not love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not sure if it's just me who's noticed a  couple of red flags. Every time Cerah thinks back to that time, you can see the pain but she brushes it off by saying, it's the grace of God. And she's maintained this statement in so many interviews. It's a way for her to block and shield herself and say God is with me. She still is hurting. Two, Abraham using reverse psychology on Cerah because she saw the photo on the phone. And even the verbal aggression that follows when he says 'We have rules in this house concerning the phone. Three, Maureen. She says she always asked how Cerah was doing. They sound as though they were doing her a favour or it'd be less hurtful if they care for Cerah. Four, Abraham and Maureen have a very deep connection. Even the way they talk about each other. There's a certain glow. But when addressing Cerah, it feels like she gets no love or less love. 
 Lastly, when he says Cerah cried after he told the truth, there's no remorse or hurt in his face. Like when you hurt someone you love, you feel remorse. You show remorse. But there's none. 

They all need to go for therapy. Cerah must have gone through so much in order to accept this situation. I hope Cerah gets better."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are very right. I noticed also he can’t let Cerah to answer the questions Lynn was asking her . He is a typical manipulator with zero remorse
q4sWUJxjc4g,You said it from my thoughts
q4sWUJxjc4g,you are right
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All my precise thoughts. I can say with my full chest that if Cera decided to leave, Abraham would not care that much but he cannot let Maureen go. Because that is who he is in love with now. Cera ako hapo juu ni yeye anaogopa kwenda, the two of them can easily do without her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@wanjirumurimi2916 that is what all men do, revisit Jimal and Frank Kiarie-gym it. They now know better where/how it always ends."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The comments, Wueeh!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It doesn't matter how many times I watch this story even in our native language(maybe to see it in a different light), all that stands out is the selfishness of Abraham and Maureen. They didn't care how much their relationship would hurt Cerah. I feel so sorry for Cerah and I'm sending her all the hugs. Maureen I dont care how much you try to portray a good image of yourself, you are and always will be a home wrecker.  As a mom to a daughter I'm teaching her to love herself more and walk away from toxic people and for my son to do better when it comes to love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes teach her she has options...and walking away is one
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said my sister👏🏽👏🏽
q4sWUJxjc4g,She doesn't have to stay anyway and I wonder what she is still doing there.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who will put on the white gown????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am not condemning Abraham but it really shows that he loves Maureen more, there was no talk of love for Sarah. I know its still not easy for her she just tag along because of Abraham and his business. I wish them all the best anyway."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeeuuuuh ..... Just weeeeeuuuuh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That place Maurine is explaining why she was mad,that laugh for all of you is sarcastic, sorry"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is the  (Nichol Kessinger) of Kenya, only that this Father Abraham loves his wife but somehow she (moreen) must have wanted the life of  Cera and her kids. She pretends she didn't know he was married.....blah blah....like koxokoxo.... But time will tell. She is the true meaning of  evil mistresses. Cerah has no problem at all, its just 2 evil adults making evil choices and trying to sanitize themselves by bringing their victim closer. Maureen is controlling Father Abraham thats the fact which Cera will never come to terms with."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You have used her emotional which is the core of a person, not about what each one of you is doing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God may I never go through this in Jesus's name... Can't share love.. It's painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When a man gets money all he thinks is multiple women,,,at the start amesema he used to sell grocery 😒 when he met serah😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This one I refuse even to watch..no way..
q4sWUJxjc4g,When the reality  of polygomous marriage knocks at ua door that's when u will learn ua own lesson.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am happy for this family , you brought another picture of family,,, God be with you ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Are you ok madam?i think u should go back and watch the video all over again before you give such abnormal comments , this is disgusting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So you say serah did nothing for you to go out and start a relationship with moureen,these shows you are very selfish man,feel so sorry for serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,to my side I don't support polygamy...I come from a polygamy family....my dad got married to our house help....and it is not easy as you think..it's very hard.....Love can not be shared....the bible says a man should have one wife and not two.
q4sWUJxjc4g,All commenting are stupid there is a religion you can marry up to 4 and it's allowed...men Are naturally polygamist forgot mpango wa kando we marry 4
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh God! 😭😭.. May my daughters never meet this kind of a man.. 😢😢.. A man without conscience.. Khai?! 😨.. And God help me raise them so that they don't turn out like Maureen,.... The pain 😩.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham settled before he knew what he wanted...he wished to have two personalities in one person which is impossible.
q4sWUJxjc4g,These women look alike and have the same gestures. Their personalities are different though - Cerah is a bit more reserved than Maureen not necessarily that she is sad. Cerah is a clever woman hence she moved the situation to work in her terms.
q4sWUJxjc4g,the man is very selfish and im sure the first wife willl leave one day. i cant stand such men
q4sWUJxjc4g,this man cant tame his late and most men are this evil yet suppose another man takes his first wife what would he do. may be one day he might have to swallow the bitter pill as most women leave once children are big
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@lynn Ngugi, You asked all the questions I had. Kudos! But you are light and you were in heels🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me I can't🙌🙌🙌I will allow this when my side chick i s at lang'ata  cemetery🙌🙌
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this is ru8bbish and pure lies 
this man thinks he has these women so he pampers his pride. its a clear lie!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can really feel for Sarah.it was so hurting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the looks,Cerah is not happy about the fact that she's sharing..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am no one to judge but Abraham you really did wrong to Cerah, at no point in his explanation was he even apologetic to her for cheating he feels as if he did her no wrong .You can just tell by how shes looking at Abraham explain his infidelity that the wound is yet to heal  koz it takes her back to the pain she felt when she found out. Just because she accepted the second woman and learned to live and cope with her doesnt mean she was not hurt. Shes human she felt the betrayal her reasons to stay with you are well known to her but  i just hope she never stayed due to fear of raising her kids alone ,lack of job or she felt she didnt deserve better. Shes a very beautiful woman who deserved better than you two gave her. Based on how you talk its like she had to be accustomed to the  changes in the family. Cerah you deserve better but if your happy we are happy for you after all it is a personall decision just dont drown you self in settling for less theres more out there ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is Soo wrong by all standards.... My heart bleeds for our generation.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Infidelity is infidelity, Serah wake up and leave that marriage. Maureen you broke Serah's marriage knowingly. May the guilt eat you for the rest of your life together with Father Abraham"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A man can only love one woman . And make her happy . I am from a polygamous family ,growing up wasn't easy ,my mother was the first woman in . Another was brought . I saw riches tumble down...we struggled just because another was brought in... By the help of God ,Jesus ...I will not subject subject my woman to this . And plus depending on where this happens ,in some places you will have to deal with witchcraft ,each woman will be trying a way   to please the one man..i have seen ,no fairy tale # no to polygamy ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very very true.. 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s easy to try and make everything about yourself but this situation here is far much different from what you had in your family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just try to heal bro the deal is done
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are siblings in this
q4sWUJxjc4g,At least a man has commented  and is against polgamy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is a HOME-WRECKER. Period. Serah is in pain and denial; she needs therapy and financial empowerment to walk away from this madness. Abraham has just perfected the art of narcissism. I really pity the kids growing up in this setup. 
Honestly this story just makes me nauseous. Can ladies just know their worth for once? Serah needs to wake up. As for Maureen, this is just the ordinary bit** preying on married men. Even if she leaves the setup, she will still chase another married man because she has no values in her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish u all the best ,they are blessed ,so let's not judge before listening to the all story ......may the lord bless u all .....big up lynn for having them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its a hard No
For me 😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's their choice but Sarah she is in pain though
q4sWUJxjc4g,After watching this my advice to my beautiful daughters pliz don't allow this to happen in your life work hard and get your own money usikubali kua Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People who are  blaming Sera for accepting her co-wife are the very people who would judge her if she had done something wrong to her co she did the best to accept her in because nothing would  change their love cox Maureen already had a kid with Abraham.Sera thanks for your kindness and calmness very many women are in jails because if fighting and even killing their co-wives kudos to you my dear.And for Abraham thanks for taking good care of both of them,loving them and keeping peace in the  home.Maureen I know you realise how nice Sera was and still is for accepting you in softly cox its not easy.So I pray you respect her and pay her back  good too."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who said killing a Co wife is the only solution, I think you're being very unreasonable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Habibtay Thanks for your concern about my opinion but I think you didn't get the message in it.I was simply appreciating Sera for being unique and calm to accept her co-wife without causing any danger.Its rare to find such a woman believe me.I feel its not good to criticise and judge her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is just plain selfish and manipulative. Clearly Serah is hurting. You can see the pain in her eyes. I hope she gets the strength to leave this toxic situationship
q4sWUJxjc4g,😏🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This set up soothes the man's ego ,he said they even iron his socks,they may end up worshipping him,wooiii but I love humble Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't know why I am this angry, towards this man the audacity in him is so annoying, he thinks he's a prince or what. As for Cera she deserves a better person I pray someday she relises how worthy she's to be with such a proud so called husband and leave this marriage because all I see in Cera's eyes is sadness no matter how strong she tries hiding. I think Cera thinks she can't find someone better than this man especially after so much sacrifice in her marriage. But No Cera you deserve the best it's never too late in life. LYNN much love watching from Cameroon 🇨🇲. ♥ ♥"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I like how Lynn you are so articulate on how you question them full of wisdom. Not being judgemental or anything it's not easy may God give you grace grace .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"WTF! These two sociopaths are acting like victims, when they are the problems. This guy and his side chic made a choice that was obviously forced on to Cera, her posture says a lot! He mentions ‘being a good wife...’, how about reciprocating and being a friggin faithful husband!!! Wonder how he’d be if Cera was the one doing this mess. There’s no part in this where he has remorse for what he has done to Cera. Maureen doesn’t know half her own story, sounds like she knows exactly what she was doing. Abraham is a closet narcissist."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeeeeh....😥😥😥😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,"okaaay!!!
bt hii story inatuteach nini??
coz no way i can ever have a hrt of ""cera""..

q4sWUJxjc4g,Time will tell no matter you hide us love is jealousy what you value most  is always confidential serah is strong  she has gone miles ahead but your betrayal to her is a secret hidden in her heart otherwise  the greatest desire of a dying or weak soul is more time it'll stand again  to rejoice am not condemning  it's only my view
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen you didn’t make a right decision it’s not easy to be in somebody space more so into someone marriage it’s not biblical ad Godly,Cerah you’re brave sweet mum thanks being there ad strong for you’re family.Abraham you cheated on your wife cerah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It take the strong to stay in abusive marriage and the strongest to walk out of the abusive marriage
Cerah,may God give you peace and strength to work out of this abusive marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,THIS MAN IS JUST BORING... SORRY SERAH.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn..you are a very talented journalist
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen Maureen God will punish you you had a chance to leave him when you found out he was married, ungekula tu but don't get pregnant of someone else's husband"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Muraan and this guy played with cera emotional feelings
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a bomb shell relationship waiting to blow
q4sWUJxjc4g,much pain for serah...maureen is more loved here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What is 💕 love? Simple,.. do me as you would wish me do to you..... This is man ego..... Of African men ...
. cera is the person holding on this so called love .... This is pure soft betrayal"
q4sWUJxjc4g,For my point of view Abraham has no love for sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lord have mercy 💔💔💔.This is just unfathomable.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Women should submit, Men are supposed to Love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huna hata adabu wewe.u saw her cry n u still insisted that u were not going to leave ur sidechick.i just hate this
q4sWUJxjc4g,the only trick part is staying together.... polygamy is nothing new.... this is the best direction to take as youths
q4sWUJxjc4g,Every time Maureen opens her mouth I see devil canning attitude she is just a bad omen to this beautiful family but now since they are already here may Cerah get to realize her worth and know she deserves the best they are trying so hard to show the world they are doing well which brings on so many questions...
q4sWUJxjc4g,I shouted “Jesus! what a life”
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oga, I cannot bear this life anymore ‼️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jesus christ
q4sWUJxjc4g,This second wife is guilty even as she speaks. She got a low deal time will tell.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn i love your engaging personality,i love the way you are Tailoring the interview your friendly demeanor;good job"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Young ladies,ebu tumieni hii kama revision material, 
Never feel guilty of wanting an already made man, Wacha this son of Jezebel wavumiliwe na mama zao. It's clear wakiwa chini wakona wewe since you're the only one available but not their type.
Wakiwa sawa wanatafuta type yao.
Stay woke warembo."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Infidelity sugarcoated sera you deserve better let them be and move on.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"U can't love two, Sarah hapa Hana say, sana sana moreen ndio priority when is sera time to talk Abraham takes over.... For me I DNT advocate for this.... Marriage certificate is of one and not two...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm not trying to be judgemental but honestly how long will this friendship last? I don't know but i just feel sorry for the first wife sera. Yes polygamy is there but two women living in the same roof is  scam!..this can't work.
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can you create feelings for someone's husband until you end up in your fellow woman's house aaaiii nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh can't watch this Lyn this is the betral to the first wife. I may never know what sera is going thru but gal go back to your parents or build your own life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"'no apologies""kwani who cares 🧐🙄...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing to be proud about, especially hey same house, traditionally wives were in different houses.. with kids growing to young adult.the picture isn't even close to normal, hugs to sera n much strength, Maureen n Abraham have met their desires.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeeeeh!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You can clearly see Cera is in so much pain, she is just doing this for the cameras but that woman is deeply troubled, may God's gift of assertiveness and decisiveness locate her!Abraham and Maureen are just two big manipulators"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My view is that for maureen its defintly easy to respect sara because she is no threat to her.Maureen is defintly the love of abrahams life she knows that so theres nothing threatening her.She even knows she doesnt need to be getting more kids to secure this love so she is not doing the most on that part.The other question is just how will they do birth control here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,cerah is so beautiful than Maureen this is pure betrayal aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,Acheni uogo hakuna mwanamke anapenda kuingililiwa na mwanamke mwingine Cera anavumilia tu hata uso unaonyesha uchungu ako nayo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is more beautiful than maureen, weuh, I hope Cerah loves herself and leaves this marej because clearly Abraham loves Maureen more, so sad 😔 😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This should be turned into a movie..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support this at all. The man was mean to the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How I wish a 3rd wife can come in the picture. 
I would love to see how moreen would take it.
Nonsense"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this guy is selfish, he wanted to have his cake and eat it...fullstop.   i feel sorry for the Sarah, May God continue to give her grace and strength.  As for Maureen, an affair is an affair whether physical or emotional, so she cannot pretend to not have wronged Sarah. I am just praying that there wont be a 3rd and 4th one"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The guy got a good wife, Cera has a very big heart. How can you go for coffee dates with another woman when your wife is waiting for you at home? The Bible shows us examples of poligamous families and we all know the struggles those families went through. The part he said he loves them all, but can't talk of that in terms of percentage really got me sad because we have completely lost direction and misuse the word love. If you are dating someone and you realise this person has a family, why do you still go ahead and have a child with this person? No guys, this is not right. People have changed marriage, a beautiful institution created by God to something else."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And Serah is too beautiful than anything else
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let me tell you ""that whole month she waited to ask you about Maureen,naah naaah naah,that was pure trauma""you are a narcissist Abraham. I swear you won't see it coming BUT cerah will fry you with your own fat 🤣🤣🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The husband the seconds wife are hypocrites ,it's written all over their  faces.They are heartless  taking advantage  of the kindness of the first wife.In kikuyu we say mamumbikiire kiihu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is soo disturbing, am a single mother and I  cannot  stomach this.hugs to the first wife .The pain in her eyes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Only real experts can notice Sarah's body language😂😂😂Her body language shows that of a person with suppressed feelings and thoughts but she is afraid to visibly come out and speak her true self....That man with a nice voice and a dimple on his right cheek is immoral,those ladies are helpless and have no choice but to blend the family,no cap!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have a question here: why do people want to make it to heaven but they don’t work towards heavenly things?

It’s going to be terrible and horrible for people who think they will make heaven and missed out on that great day.

Nobody judges another but our actions judges us secretly and openly.
Muslims are justified by their beliefs to marry four wives, but what happened in the case of one who claimed to be a Christian?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hakuna story miiingi hapa...the guy cheated period...ata aseme nini..it is wat it issss...maureen u shuldnt hv been going out on coffee dates wid a married man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hakuna story miiingi hapa...the guy cheated period...ata aseme nini..it is wat it issss...maureen u shuldnt hv been going out on coffee dates wid a married man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is very pretty and she also has a pure heart...she deserves better... I hope she gets the grace to move out of this toxic marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The compound effect 😊👍🏿!
Long live the Abraham’s empire representing the silent Majority 😃✅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah I hope you will use this publicity to rise...to market your business of  interior design. Sign up deals. Open your YouTube page where you speak about interior works. Be active on Instagram and am telling you people will love you and am glad we discovered you because this is God making you shine. Make lemonade out of this lemons. May you shine Soo bright that it burns their eyes mamma. And I hope when you make it you will get out of this with a happy, content heart and much stronger 💪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If I were Sarah...I could be narrating this while in lang'ata women prison😒😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissistic man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Early ages,women have sex with who they want,men have sex with who they can,,late years women marry who they can ,mens marry who they want,, whatever you do with these information is up to you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These three are obviously good friends! ""Abraham and Sarah"" remember the couple from the land of Ur? 😊😜"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The rate at which women here are giving out opinions says alot 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ata sijui nasema nini 🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,We can Pretend now Serah is in agreement of everything going on but with time .....she is a human being burning inside. Maureen ni mpango wa kando tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only one comfortable in this set up is Abraham the two ladies are simply condoning each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weak and indulgent man is what I see. Better get into it knowing he is a polygamous man like men of old, rather than being strung along then he indulges his passions when you're in the thick of it. I see disloyalty..we are all human with bodily passions. Love is exercising restraint when these passions flare, and they do. Serah has been sold short."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah resembles Sarah wa Kabu
q4sWUJxjc4g,this man wah siezi date such too selfish I pitty the 1st wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He loves one, he lusts over the other"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well done Serah, for bringing the enemy closer, you're so wise, our father in heaven will finish this enemy for you, the Bible tells us, who ever separate the two I've joined together, definitely the person will perish, yaani will be destroyed. And the man who marries two wives don't live long, especially in this Era, Satan is real at war, in this world, mama's prays for your daughters, make sense into their  head, before they mature. Serah at the end of the tunnel the man will remain yours, even our heavenly father is jealous of his pple worshipping other God, msitudanganye, one man one woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Honestly I feel for Serah. She's been disrespected over and over again and I feel she's used to it. Stays coz Abraham is a good dad. I pray one day she's loved like she deserves to be because she clearly has a heart of gold.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Would you allow your brother to marry a singo momma of three? No. Let her stay with her husband 👌
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@MyJOSE2013 am all in for genuine love. It's not about the children and truth is I have no control over who my brother decides to marry or not. He has his reasons. This one is a whole different situation and Serah doesn't look happy and truth is she deserves better
q4sWUJxjc4g,Josephine wairumi.is it a must one to be married self love is quite important. Self worth
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So heartbreaking for a woman to have to go through this. Dear Sarah. Do not compromise your happiness for anything. We only have one life to live.Please leave if you don't feel appreciated and loved as you should. There is always shared custody and if Abraham is responsible as you all paint him to be he will surely take care of his children. You are too kind mamaa, don't allow people to walk on you just anyhow and I know you are hardworking as well you can build your own empire as well. Please do not settle for the bare minimum. I know God will bless whichever path you choose and this time you will get lucky. Believe and claim it!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissists will manipulate you mpaka you forgot your worth. These women are both hardworking and can take care of themselves minus this loser
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love serah and I feel sorry for her....leave that fool
.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know ignorance is bliss...but living in the same house is risky. Its like putting all your eggs in the same basket.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera you can do better. From how this guy meets these ladies,he is an opportunist.It is not true love but chauvinism"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True. And he only buys women coffee. Probably cheap and the women are pulling his weight
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@danielljuma3353 the audacity to bring another woman in his wife's house shows the level of disrespect he have for women.Maureen should not count herself lucky, maybe another lady is being bought coffee😃"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This situation is a ticking time bomb, dear man, fear women. The heart of a woman is wicked. Keep thinking Serah is calm and polite smh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the most disgusting man I have even watched on this show. Narcissism reloaded
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see a man with low self esteem who is manipulative. How do you take down your kid's picture because you are sacred another woman who is not your wife will see it? He is so disgusting and just plain dumb
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry but the guy doesn't even sound smart
q4sWUJxjc4g,He said cera is the whole package but still got another woman...this tells u ..u being a good woman will never take u anywhere..dog man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Vile second wife anafinya sauti...wueh!!
I won't judge."
q4sWUJxjc4g,She and the dog man are one and the same. Awful 😞😞😞😞😞😞
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To be honest have watched all the interviews n Serah is in pain, I wish Maureen can go to her own house apatie Serah space wah amemkanyanga sana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love Sara she seems genuine,humnle and very intelligent… she is super cute!!!!!! she seems hurt… huyu Maureen ntks!!! talking too much!!! not genuine!!! would love to see this family in some years!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is just one wonderful unique woman, Abraham should be so thankful cause she’s the main glue that keeps this family together. She had an option of either leaving or staying and don’t accept Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is pain hidden in cerah... She is not well at all 
..my God grant you peace of mind.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham talks to much
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish serah could come to her senses, realize how toxic this realationship is and run away for the sake of her mental health,this is a real narcissist, they manipulate to suit their own egos not caring about their partners feeling,see how beautiful and smart serah is, my heart bleeds for you dea serah,praying for u,huyu mwanaume amekorogewa,and that's the trend today, He's mentally unstable!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Asiye na mwana aelekee jiwe. While this type of family arrangement is not for everyone, I honestly believe that men are viewing this relationship differently from women. Firstly, going by the comments and observations of most women here, it is obvious that they highlight their own insecurities when they purport to criticise or even pity Cera. Let it be known out there that if Cera was unhappy, there would be no talk shows happening here. Secondly, people are forgetting that these two women have also taken up a line of their own, they are friends and the friendship is growing as they continue to live together. Maureen is the sensitive one but very honest in her approach in this relationship. She would not have been seated here if she sensed or experienced any hostility from Cera. This is certainly one of those unique arrangements but they seem happy. Therefore no need to try and pity Cera or criticise Maureen . Thanks Lynn for presenting this family in this show, we love them just as they are."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women are insecure and controlling and they want to dominate and rule a man if a man is foolish He will let it. Just like in nature the male has more females so would i not let a woman control me. After a certain age life is not about sex/ man anymore but raising a society.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If narcissism was a person. Honestly, this is sad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham won't let  Serah talk  "" wacha nikusaidie "" and Maureen seems to forget their story a little bit too much begs the question is this story doctored. Too many inconsistencies. Sending love to Serah ❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1.The man is selfishness personified.
2.He is a believer yet he has not legally married his wife and was committing adultery with a second woman. 
3. You don't get to say 'do not judge', the Bible is very clear that we shall know them by their fruits.
4. There were too many inconsistencies in his story.
5. I found it disturbing that he kept jumping in to answer even when questions were directly addressed to  Sarah, almost as if he didn't want her to have a voice.
6. He spent a lot of time defending Maureen but not reassuring Sarah, as if her feelings do not matter at all.
7. It's sad that Maureen feels that the luckiest day of her life was when she met him when he is actually the one who is fortunate to have met her.
8. I have a feeling he is already paying another woman's rent.
There will  likely be a 3rd and 4th in the near future.
9. Maureen, you are not even legally married, move on and start again.
You are clearly hardworking and intelligent. You can build Sarah's empire instead of Abraham's empire."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't like the caretakers, serah I feel  sorry for you my sister akuna mwanamke anapenda hiyo life no matter what!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My grandpa had two wives but live in same compound different houses I don't really support polygamy but that's better off to be in different homesteads than this💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't wait till the end. The pain in Cera's eyes is too much to bear.  She is fighting tears a lot. She is in pain and I can't stomach it. I pray she finds the courage one day to choose herself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True, I can see how much she was holding tears. I don't know her smile, but this look so fake."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,I disagree with this...Cera needs Respect
q4sWUJxjc4g,This kinda pain no woman would want to go through.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,So if one woman has an infection the three of them will have it...wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,men like these are civilized narcicist....may god never allow me to stoop this low to encourage such nasty idealogy of men like these...the first woman should have left the circus
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For me, on behalf of me,I myselofu and me me hii nayo  siwezi  ,I want to see my kid's grow and such arrangement will send me to kamiti or grave, so all the best ladies."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I fear God, then Sarah alafu the kenyan economy in that order 🙆🙆🙆."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This girl Cera isn't stupid. I know she is planning her exist...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeh! Here for the comments. No words. This is crazy!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Maureen is a big hypocrite if u wanted him to go to his wife you could stop and cut communications, this man is disgusting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Feel guilty and u were sleeping with someone's husband I feel like slapping her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am sure this guy will go for 3rd 4th..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why not
q4sWUJxjc4g,So cerah alikupata ukikata skuma. Huyu mwingine alipata Mansion. Anyway kupumzika ni binguni. I wish u hapiness. For me ad rather die. 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I watched this interview in shock.

So number 1. This guy was still having coffee dates with Maureen when the wife was pregnant. 
2. When the baby was born he even deleted the photo of the baby because shit Maureen had seen the photo and he didn't want to lose her.
3. So coffee dates with Serah, which was how their relationship started turned out to coffee dates with Maureen almost immediately after she moved in.
4. Serah talked about how Abraham never used to come home because of ooh it was raining too much and all and she even had to move closer to Nairobi for him to come home. This man took advantage of how much she loved him. She only said that , that period was very difficult and didn't want to delve deeper so as not to make her friends uncomfortable.
5. Serah said aki mapenzi wewe three times - and it is evident from that statement this is not what she wanted and signed up for but to still have the man she loves has to endure.
6. Serah said she often has to tell Abraham that amemtupa sana. Maureen said nothing,, meaning this two people who work together are often soo caught up in themselves and sometimes Abraham even forgets about her. 
For me this is just a deep story about betrayal. Both Abraham and Maureen have deeply hurt and betrayed Serah . I hope one day she loves herself to realize that she deserves better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well put
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women should learn to see red flags 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪Sio Kwa ubaya but ukijifanya doormat no one to baby you. She should have seen the red flags and acted those first moments. You teach people how to treat you💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,very true this slogan of polygamist is demonic we are not going to embrace it at all i can feel for celar the red flags are quite alarming wish she could see what we are seeing she's living with two hypocrite person God intervene
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@DorisWanjohiGifttv true you teach people how to treat you
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@DorisWanjohiGifttv but when you don't know better you don't do better
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Second time to watch this story. Men are polygamous in nature. This youngman has decided to do it openly unlike many who hide until they are gone causing lots of surprises to the first family.  However, my suggestion as a mother is, Abraham should buy enough land to build two houses for these two ladies.  That way, each shall live an individual life.  The children shall grow together. Hmmmm. 
Every child needs to be raised by both parents.  Money cannot replace love. 
To conclude, let's not throw all the stones. It this is a sin, we all sin differently.

Off to their channel."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is brave unlike those men who r polygamous secretly siring children  n not taking care of them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have watched this in other platforms but let me comment here😘....
1.Which lady in her 30s would wish to be a second wife.....this second lady is just evil, and I guess to her all she thought would happen was for the first lady to leave yy abaki kuwa the only wife.
2. This guy said they had a misunderstanding between him and her wife that led to cheating and even impregnating another woman, where on earth would we have an urgument in the house leading even marrying a second wife
3.This first wife is desperate and looking at things that this is the best thing that that has happened in her life ""Father Abraham"" she is not ready to loss but what form of disrespect yaani mtu alete another woman in my house 🤔they just wanted her to leave but oooops yeye ni k.....
4.How on earth could I be sleeping alone when I am very sure my husband is having intimate with another lady just  in the same house......aaaaaiiii the disrespect yaawaaa and akikuja kwako you still opening your legs  and continuing getting pregnant.....
5. Father Abraham said he is a family man na anapenda familia kubwa.....to me if you are capable of bringing up watoto wako vizuri I will give birth to even 16 our parents did it na hawakufanya anything so second is not an excuse of a big family.
6.This guy seems rich, right 🤔why are the women living together he should Jenga different houses for both of them.
7. This first Woman is insisting she is okay,my dear you are not just stop faking......it's better when you are single because you will be smiling and a real one than this, kwani ww huwezi jilisha than forcing yourself to love someone who loves someone else then mfanye co-parenting
7. Back in high school tulifunzwa love is jealous but naona here it's like am just okay akiwa na yy ama Mimi.
8. Ladies jiheshimuni,stop dating married man trust God for your own Man,yaaani msichana mdogo hakuwa na any other man kwa life yake?????
9.This guy is  like read the bible and get to understand it........Harooooooo if you think that you can do as some men in the bible why have you stopped at two,marry as many as you can and leave a legacy 🚮
10. Giki ni kiumbani...... anyway if they are happy who am I not not to be 😊but the first lady is being foooooooled anyway endelea kuzaaa kama panya tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ignorance is a very big disease and that's why a woman should be fully empowered 'independent so that when a man comes in with this stupidity you leave them there to move on to the next choice of co wife. my opinion it's not genuine  relationship but just for convenience 'one man one woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The audacity to bring 2nd wife in sera home is what's pissing me off..angemtafutia nyumba ingine na hukoooooooo..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Master this thing is very heart breaking, l can't imagine being in the shoes of the first wife. 
Which sort of betrayal is that and he is trying to put out that nothing is wrong, the first wife is hurt but just holding on ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the happiest man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let's not sugar coat this ,as for me I feel that this man cheated on his wife...point blank"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is an adulterer! Period! You can try and argue all you want. There is NO way you can love two people equally 🙄😟.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow! . When I started watching the episode , I was like what in the world, but after listening to your story I am truly impressed of how you all have come together to make the  family dynamic work. Serah you are a beautiful, amazing woman with a heart of gold for accepting Maureen into your family.. I can not imagine the heart ache , and feeling of  betrayal when you found (mami  you are a better woman than me by a million folds)."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its all fake for camera u don't live with them,time will tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This will not be the end of this man. In a span of less than four years ,she had two wives. By the time he gets to his 40's , he will still desire another woman.Having two wives does not mean that a man will not desire another or sleep around.

Some can't just crucify their bodies , and especially if you are a believer , the devil is allover using what may look"" inspiring "" to deceive many."
q4sWUJxjc4g,That's true he will marry another girl before he turns 40
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True, women are beautiful, no 3 and 4 loading,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,he will be a sperm donor to many. very useless man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bingo! I just said he'll get a third wife and then the real drama will unfold.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My thoughts too. He will cheat on the two and Maureen will be most hurt. Have you ever seen the reaction of a thief who has been stolen (direct translation)?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham’s Empire!  You have a Family Subscribed to your Channel all the way from Lake Nona; Florida USA.  I must commend these 3.

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is how it should be.  Love over hate and jealousy.  Many controlling insecure women are against it because to them its all about me me me
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's Abraham and Sarah what do you expect. The names follow them as in from the bible version Abraham had wives and many children
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Matter of fact
1. Cerah is not happy, her eyes, her smile tell it all
2. Once Cerah is financially stable, she'll leave
3. Cerah's self esteem is low.
4.Maureen and Abraham are in love. Cerah is just the other person here. She loves Abraham, but Abraham doesn't.
5.Abraham is a narcissist
6. Wueeh if it were me, I can't stand even a minute."
q4sWUJxjc4g,#5.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen and Abraham may be in love, but be sure when Cera leaves their 'love' relationship won't be same.  There must always be a supply to the narcissist and Cera is playing that part now."
q4sWUJxjc4g,spot on. True definition of a  Narcissistic personality. Triangulating relationships.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are a genius😂😂😂... perfectly analyzed
q4sWUJxjc4g,That’s why you are not married 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I cud not stand listening to this story to the end.what Maureen is saying is bullshit, total crap, how cud she lay with a married man knowingly and  get pregnant with him? 
I am sure she wanted to break them up and keep the man .
Sarah tu ndio ameshikilia Hiyo marriage  na pain.
Abraham  is lacking pure love. Akipata mwingine ataendelea tu.
Obviously he doesnt know what love is."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just total BS, the Bible said a woman will leave her parents to join her husband who also will leave his parents to form a union and family, I didn't see a woman will leave their parent to join another home that's is already built, why love another person's husband?? Loving 2 is impossible it's called selfishness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men are greedy ppl the never satisfied smh!!  Why you want another wife isn't your first wife enough for you??
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I listen to their previous interviews the first wife said dealing with Abraham isn't easy especially in the morning niwale wakutafutiwa mbaka socks ikose tu asubui 😢so she wanted the second wife to live with them so she can deal with that, a  good example of loving a man when he has nothing only to disrespect you when he gets money let us wait to hear from them 5 yrs later"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We feel sorry for Serah she is really 😢 heartbroken 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well, i know of polygamous families but staying under the same roof is kinda uncomfortable. Sera maybe feared that if they stay apart, she would loose Abraham to Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even after Maureen knew Abraham was a married man you pretend so much you cared about cera,if you cared  about cera you wouldn't have taken her man walked in her house"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He came out to get viewers on YouTube.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He has the best of both worlds, to have two women that cares for him and gives their bodies to him. He has all he needs.i would love to see a woman with two husbands."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can only describe this man as Avery heartless person..his first wife is so beautiful and she looks humble but she represents people who gets deeply betrayed by the people they have genuinely loved
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those that can see, Serah is masking a lot of pain on such betrayal…. Abraham seem to love Moreen more than Serah. He should put them in different houses to allow each have her own space and time."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mungu uke wenza unipate kaburini not even in different houses
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that he cheated on Serah, that was wrong on every level period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It still early to predict this marriage Serah will leave disrespect will having two wives in one house that big no
q4sWUJxjc4g,I believe Lynn will one day interview Serah after leaving this toxic relationship. This man should have catered for his girlfriend's needs while away. Imagine building a house then side chic analetwa. Nothing to  be proud of here. Hugs 🤗 Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara your so  beautiful & you have a beautiful heart too..may our faithful God take you far.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not easy at all, first thing serah did was assurance and acceptance...then trying to live with it forever."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you Lyn for bringing this family from heaven. This union is truely blessed  keep strong
q4sWUJxjc4g,No real love here! It's just a guy who is playing with two women's emotions.  The guts of the second woman is so deep. I can't be the second wheel intentionally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ask men if they can swallow this if it should come from their wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is one of those stories that I cant just waste my time watching it to the end.In this century, what lessons are we learning from this? What positive impact does it have? Young girls and women in general need to know their self worth and to never settle for less. This is just wierd and unjustifiable! Marriage institution is divine and ought to be respected period! Lets not sugarcoat betrayal and infidelity/ adultery. In addition, the foundation of each marriage really matters.
My observation though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will still bring more women. Nothing is enough for him
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@senaitafeworki8423 yeees yesss it won't stop🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@CateRN-d5g that's how start
q4sWUJxjc4g,That's me dea never can ever settle for this ata kama niko na ten kids my happiness is important
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I doubt if this dude truly loved or loves his first wife Cerah from the word go. At no given point has he shown any remorse for  heartlessly hurting her. How he comfortably sits there, beside her to be specific, smiling, narrating and justifying his betrayal and infidelity in details to the whole world as if they are  virtues to be emulated is baffling and annoying.
For Cerah, it is crystal clear that this is not what she signed up for but just found herself in it. To her, the situation is what it is and she has to put up with. Pole sana mami.Its never too late to pick up yourself."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You guys hugged for real ? Awwwn Serah has a heart of gold I personally can't take it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do you feel used?🤣🤣🤣 Weeh Lyn
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah eeey you are making me cry 😭 how can you say you weren't sad getting to meet Maureen .Abraham you are supposed to be a politician
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Following this, Serah literally had no choice bc if she said no to Maurine and left Abraham wouldn't mind being with Maurine I admire  her strength and courage from her reaction towards her husband's promiscuousness her reaction is so rare and a commendable one .I honestly don't think love can equitably be shared between more than one woman in a relationship as marriage if at all a man can, there's a high probability that jealousy and hatred would exist with this I  strongly stand against polygamy Abraham and Maureen owe a lot of apologies to Serah I see hurt within her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen says be a second wife for the sake of the kids....my question is....why have kids with a married man in the first place?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man is full of wisdom, actually people should learn to mind their own business"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who else has noticed that stupid humanise hasn’t done with other ladies ? Trust me not that man is having loads of affairs outside despite having two wives!! No 3 is loading unfortunately. His still a playboy acting like a teenager licking his cursed lips . Idiot 😡😡😡😡
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Many women envy Serah for having to stay in her marriage even though there was infedility. They envy the fact that the father of her children is still fully present in their children's life. Some had to divorce their spouses even though they still loved them because of being afraid of what people would think of them had they stayed. I'm not condoning abuse as long as Serah is not abused and is at  peace and respected i see nothing wrong with her decision to stay. As a woman who believes in God she isn't sinning against God  by  staying in her marriage instead its her husband.

I know there are also those who are sincerely concerned about her. After all it's her own decision to make. Let us not project our own decisions on her. If she feels like she she loves her husband enough to stay that is up to her. I applaud her for following her heart and not being pressured by societal standards. 

Many spouses are staying with adulters in their marriages who are not yet revealed. According to God adultery is when one looks at a woman or man who aren't married to them in a sexual manner that is called adultery or cheating. If you have a man or woman who looks at another women or man in a sexual manner who isn't their spouse they are no different from Serah's husband according to God. Even though they haven't acted yet to their heart desires they are the same. 

I know this is an unpopular opinion but it had to be said."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just wondering, how can they live together in the same house? Abraham should man up and follow traditions to the end. There's nothing as two women living in the same house as co-wives. Manipulation and ignorance of the highest order. What will happen if Abraham strays again and brings a third woman into the picture? What do the women think will stop him from doing so? This story is just very bizarre."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its painfull though I will never accept any woman who comes in between a married couple and expect we clap for her she knew this man was married..she could have avoided.A big No for ME.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I watched the all episode at  night..1.... Cerah u choose this to save  Ur marriage  and your kids.ur not happy mummy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looks like Cera did not have a choice from how Abraham is talking. It is was ultimatum to either stay or leave. Unbelievable.  He is a narcissist without doubt. "" I told her sikufukuzi, I will not change my support, blah blah. So annoying."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kila mwanamke awe na mji wake sio afya wala hski kukaa nyumba moja huo ni uongo km wanasema wanaenjoy kuwa chini ya same roof .hakuna kitu km hicho.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wait what?? another woman brings attitude early morning ati you pembeleza her?? ati najua sija kukosea🤥🤥 this is the hardest life anybody has to deal with!! why can't each be in their own houses for space nkt! serahs pain and body language tells it all! Poor thing maureen, shame on you!  She is being forced on everything, serah ata kucheka nikuji force, once you got into her life she had no choice but comply, so yes you are a destroyer."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ladies did you hear? You can be supportive, submissive and respectful yet a man that wants to go outside his marriage will still go. Woman, invest in yourself."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"aky..jst look how cera is humble, committed & collected..
bt still fisi ni fisi tuuu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's only that Abraham met a woman who was ready to put her legs apart for him n that woman is Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pewa three 20litres salad ya golden fry kwa bill ya baba watoto
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kabisa..sooo discouraging
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wafungue YouTube channel waanze kumfanyia pranks basi😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Joan mimi nikubali kushare kaduduu mmh catch me deeeeeadd
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If they're all happy, well and good... Somehow I love these ladies, they're not selfish and are smart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is lying....at some point, I didn't know he was married...in another instance, I all along had Sarah's number. 
Another instance, we just used to have coffee dates, then she got pregnant...
I used to tell him to go home,...yet Serah said that she would feel the husband is not giving attention n spending out.
She knew it all along"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lord look at this short man selfishness .
Anyways to each his own but no woman should allow this kind of disrespect."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't ever support  polygamy. God  designed  one woman for one man. 
To me, Abraham doesn't  seem  to love neither  Sarah nor Maureen. He married  Sarah  to take care  of his home, he saw a homemaker  in her and married  Maureen  to help his business.  He loves himself and  is evident  in how he is talking so unashamedly.  He was even  cutting  in on Sarah as if to prevent  her from revealing  too much.  Abraham  is too young  to  put himself  in this polygamous  situation. 
For Sarah, she has resigned to fate and  is enduring  the whole saga. It is evident  that she  loves  this man and  will do anything  to not lose him completely  to another  woman. One can see the pain in her eyes. She is just managing  to put up the front that she is happy  for her husband's  sake. She is a good  person  who would sacrifice  her happiness  for her husband. 
For Maureen, you ought  to have cut off the relationship  when  you knew  Abraham  was married.  As a woman, you must  know that  one man  cannot  love 2 women. All attention  will shift to you and  the wife will be ignored.  
Abraham  and  you  are laughing  heartily, while  Sarah is just managing  a smile here and there as a cover up that all is well. 
My mum  is a 1st wife and  we children  suffered  alongside. 
Polygamy  is a curse to Africa  I would  say."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah u need to wake up and know that you are so cute for this mess... Abraham is such a selfish man all he wants us kujiskia mwanaume that he is dating 2 women and putting them in the same house is just obsert.... I would never allow this noncence... I will give my daughters tthe best so that they will not take less to this kind of men... Serah is not to late walk out men who love u will cheat in secret
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not happy she is just a bold woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,No way i cant support this Serah is not happy and she was betrayed by this narccist i hate this though lynn you have done a good intervuew🥰😍😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aiii m sichukui advice ya huyu mbaba anasema nn kwanza second wife n gari ya wapi mm niko hapa nakaa atwoli n sikubali second wife period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woiye ooh God of our ancestors why did you let this happen,,am not a hater but,, Abraham would have built another house for the second wife,to serah go to your knees this is not the guy you have been with ,those are demonic altars, demonic attacks,cry for God,,,vile mimi ningefika mombasa kwa pastor ezekiel,,koz this is not normal ata watu wakisema its normal in one roof nah,,lilia mungu mama unless hujui mungu,,enda ushikiwe imani"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I want to stand with cera on this i think she is very ok.yes there are days she will ask herself questions but i would do this anytime for my own sake. stop saying she is doing it for the husband. With respect this would actually do for me. 
The husband has clearly stated that theres no given day he ever thot of leaving cera so it means she has been treated right.
If yu ever saw yua child crying for their dad cz hes leaving yu wil understand him.
I love this family already. I want to pray that this coming out will never open pits in your life.
To Abraham the task the women hav placed on his lap is exactly wat every man needs."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara we feel your unspoken pain. May the Lord set you free.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen getting mad coz of Sera just before the show shows clearly that if it was Sera who was brought to Maureen she couldn't have agreed. Kudos Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham looks aggresive to serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My best wishes in your marriage the Abraham's ❤️
Mob love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh....Not in this or the next world would I support such..Serah is paining😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Cerah gal is not stupid. She knows what she is doing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He took the photo down of his kid!!!!!! Hii imeniuuma !!!this is painful.......
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have a feeling that Maureen wants to  have her own place n space .my opinion though.
q4sWUJxjc4g,One of the reason ladies are afraid of building from scratch with a broke man nowadays
q4sWUJxjc4g,This would be  one of my nightmares...Waahhhh its hard
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To me it's obvious why the women got to be friends they have the same personality humble, quiet and loving it's obvious Abraham would be attracted to two people that have the same personalities let's not act all of us have met either two guys or chics that they both are attracted to so it's normal it's good they are not hiding"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's a third wife coming. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Sera ana mask, but tunakuona."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you deserve better,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Every interview has a  ka different story  ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Great respect to Serah, she is the main source of all this happiness, She is one in a million, Kudos Serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One man...one wife!
You all are living a lie!..and truth and reality knocks on the door, the story will be different!
This is a “Home” built on sinking sand!..when the storms of life come blowing, it will be washed away!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel like pouring my heart out on behalf of Serah, She is so beautiful but inside her I know its an empty shell, very broken...its written all over her face, she cannot even speak clearly, the other one is so confident...Sorry mamaa, go back home Serah , restart your life its not late"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"She is the kind of a person who is so serene the one you will want to protect ,,because she has a heart of a child"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is not a good person here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is an handsome hardworking guy,I now see what Maureen saw in him.
Maureen is pretty,has class and knows how to make money, plus she soft spoken.She has a cute smile too 
But I think she deserves her own home,she is too pretty to invade another woman's space.
I think it's not right.
Abraham build Maureen her house.I think she is better in her own space
Love you all💕💕💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is sooo sweet she deserves someone to reciprocate
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is just a selfish man🙄 mscheeew.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Uongo, hii ni uongo"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"if Abraham had a pure heart,  he wouldn't betray you Cera. Narcissism detected.  He married you coz you served him."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hey Lynn and Abraham family. I really admire you and people who do polygamy. For me with all honesty I can’t. Maximum respect.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You have cracked me up girl ati hey Lynn and Abraham family🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,You'll ain't seeing the man is so handsome.  I'm here for him incase he needs a 3rd one. The GOK allows 4 wives. Lol!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacera had no choice she had gone through hell. She’s humble and nice girl!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is this lady trying to justify herself??oooh go home ,go home,...the second lady broke this family shes supposed to leave!I feel ceras pain coz i know the pain of polygamy ...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,He can't let Sarah talk but anawacha  moureen aongeee
q4sWUJxjc4g,The tears of sera  in silence prayers  one day God will answer her..nothing hurting  like sharing  aman...let me be thinned with mine..such family there should be grace
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can say that again. Am sure Sera cries silently everytime Maureen and Abraham are together.....she's not okay
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapendi  Sarah haki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs to you serah,,🥺"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor poor beautiful Serah,
Abraham, Abraham.....Please don't add another lovely lady coz you are a magnet for intelligent girls buuuut inevitably polygamy creates room for rivalry and jealousy especially where they dwell together..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera iyo urembo yote..... Aki no...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Reke nemwo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"However glamorous this story appears,this is not an example to emulate.There is a lot of sugarcoating but bottom line this kind of setting has never worked anywhere."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Seriously though......this woman serah must be from a different cloth from all of us women because wuuuuuue!!....Okay,let the man have as many wives as he wants,but we can never be this close..never."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful story!  But the elephant in the living room mat shouldn’t be there. Lol!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati it sunk in! Y’all have played with Sera and her emotions. Guys let us support purple pearls so that she can let go of this emotional abuse. Weuh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a comment reader member associations am pleased that People are WOKE. Am happy with your comments
Cerah needs to brake that soul tie with Abraham then her eyes will be opened. Coz Weuh 🙆🙆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is those slippery guys. You think he is good because of all the other boxes he ticks off and yet his a wolf in sheep’s skin.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is TOTAL MADNESS stop covering stupidity, we are parents and don’t want our daughters to fall prey of this type of selfish roaring lion calling himself a husband he is a fool"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The “you get phrase” is used by people that are striving so hard to have you believe them.  I hope the trio really gets to dive into their deepest and truest feelings about the situation.  Both women really come off as beautiful and deserving of a loving husband ❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,I belief Abraham loves Maureen but Serah was a wife materiel
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nah. It's just a figure of speech amongst Urban elite young men
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am even upset hat's sitaki hii story
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is sad at all Angles.Serah is not ok.Women we go through a lot.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wa kenya ile kitu hamtafanya doen't exist
q4sWUJxjc4g,but huyu boychild wetu anakaa kuleta ka lightskinned ka tatu😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Akazoe.... Ngai fafa... Moreen & Abraham are just selfish people.... Aki for real.... however much you try to justify it's clear.... God see sera.. through this journey....
q4sWUJxjc4g,LOVE IS EVERYTHING IN THE FAMILY SET UP.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"going by the comments you all judging maurine and majority of you here are having an affair with married men,it's only that the men are not courageous enough to introduce you to there goat wives,if this couples are happy acheni wakae"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why in the first place must you have a second chick? Why? Can you ask yourself that question????
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is speaking of respect?how can you when you're sleeping with the other woman's hubby and even getting pregnant? am lost on that  one...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Jomo Kenyatta had  two,   Mbiyu Koinange  Njenga Karume  Jm Kariuki  had  each two wives  so why not   Abraham?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,NARCISM 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
q4sWUJxjc4g,This  is wow
q4sWUJxjc4g,He truly loves Maureen I pitty Sarah she is hiding her pain but obviously she is not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think all the credit shd be to Cera she's the glue that holds this family together, she put her husband's happiness before hers accepted moreen, this man should respect cera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah has such a beautiful heart, may God help her to raise the kids and the second wife to leave and get her own husband coz she is still young and beautiful too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pia huyu atawaletea mwingine fisi ni fisi tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something is off.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If delusion had a face, ATI am a wife not a destroyer 😀😀😀"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A man that lies, cheats and betrays u doesn't  Love  u one bit.He even brings his side chick  to ur matrimonial  home.. Kindly  leave u deserve  better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So when do the two ladies get 2nd husbands and will this sad version of Abraham be as accepting
q4sWUJxjc4g,What are you trying to tell the world?
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don’t see what most people on here see. Maybe I’m more liberal but I see a loving family trying to build a home. The set up works for their family and most importantly their children. To each his own. Polygamy is African. Yes it’s not for everyone but but let’s not judge.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah,Sarah my namesake how many times did I call you.Don't do anything to please people listen to your inner self.Life is all about happiness are you really happy from inside?????From deep inside your heart are you okay?????would you advise your daughter to accommodate another lady in her marriage?????hugs from me to you ❤️❤️❤️❤️I love you Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki for me I can't...I don't like this man woii Sarah take courage  1 day tha second wife will regret nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He cheated, she found out.. He didn't give her an alternative, didn't stop it.. She had to stay probably to prove a point or because she didn't want to leave her house for the ""other woman"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy and witchcraft are flipsides of one coin. Reminds me of Hamo and Chemutai.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My grandpa had two wives but both lived kilometers away from each other...our forefathers knew better,they knew the pain and jealous that comes with polygamy..hii ya hawa Sijai skia, mi mwenyewe polygamy issa noo"
q4sWUJxjc4g,And this dude will bring 3rd Nd 4th and the trend continues 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shetani ni mwongo alishindwa na YESU.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is  extremely sad 😞. I refuse to believe there is happiness here.  
Maureen your Husband is still waiting for you ! Don’t give up waiting by getting in the middle of this loving family . 
Your child can always visit His father."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"shout it! she should also know this she will pay thru her children.question, will she be Happy to see her daughter brought to a second wife...do to pple what you want to be done to you.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why dont they just live in separate homes???¿

q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah has said she has never been happy in her entire life. This stu**d man took advantage of her problems and he is a narcissist. May God open doors for cerah and her kids coz I believe the kids are affected too. This maureen is a homewrecker and sooner than later she'll face karma. 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you deserve better.....trust me when the kids start getting to 10 yrs it will not be fun and games anymore. For now......kalungu lungu

q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn my girl aki Serah is in another class ya wakina mama she is the real deal and the reason why that relationship has worked she is very mature and that is the reason Maureen has coped and the Husband ako laini
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really love vile Abraham amekubali kuwa Sara was just a good wife...
But bado akaamua kumrudi nyuma.
So please lady's hata ufanye Nini mwanaume hawarithiki."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah's self esteem must be very, very low.. Why can't he build her co wife her own house as traditions dictate? Miss me with such bullshit!3rd wife loading, so both need to make another room in the house for her as well too. Lol"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think we should just accept their union they have gone through alot let the love continue it's just fine

q4sWUJxjc4g,Am so angry 😡 how can this happen
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know why..but I feel for Cerah....she is so calm..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a woman & a mum I can sense,see or even feel when my fellow woman is in pain...all I can see in Sarah's eyes is pain💔this lady is stomaching alot coz she doesn't have an option...the fact that she has said that ""all her life she has never been lucky with anything""says alot...she feels not good enough,unwanted and the only person who accepted her and made her a wife has now found favour in someone else's eyes and heart...she is afraid of going out there and start all over again,the single mum life,the fact that not many men can accept a woman with more than 1kid...She loves Abraham so much that she is ready to let him be happy and swallow everything...
I understand most men cheat but those who love and respect their wives make sure the cheating is discreet..they will do anything and everything to protect their marriage not even an outside kid can come between their marriage...they are ready to be babydaddy's and just support the kids but not bring the woman home...

Sarah needs to go down on her knees and ask strength, knowledge and wisdom from above to handle this issue..she is doing all this for her husband's happiness..

The guy got lots of guts and disrespect..
Hugs Sarah and start therapy as you figure how you gonna get up and choose you and your happiness..hugs mamaa❣️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera wake up in your this man is cassanova
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mind your own business. Cera is actually a very content woman in my view.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@douglaswamburu708 there are situations that will force you to be content..in cerah's case,the situation forced her to..we are our fellow women's keeper.There is no way we going to mind our own business yet cerah ain't doing good.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@douglaswamburu708 and again she is at peace for the sake of her kids,Abraham whom she actually built trust on...and as long as Abraham is happy,cerah is willing to do anything..maybe because of her past experiences with life or even home..for her to be close to her ""happiness""..She has to be content..for her children,She has to be content.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'll not pretend , i can never and I'll never be okay with polygamous never ever 😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I always ask my self, why should a man start with a wife akiwa Hana kitu, but as time goes on and grow to prosper, the person sees the wife is not worth any more, aki Cera 😢🙏❤️❤️I just lack words, your face is not happy whatsoever, Maureen Maureen you too I don't have any comments, may God intervene on first wife, this interview spoke more than I understood from the previous 2..good job Lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Coz men forget so easily and they always want something new
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is clearly not happy!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support polygamy! And for the men thinking of polygamy kindly make sure you've built two houses at least so each of them can have solitude moments!
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God save us (more so my daughters)from such men. Praying for you ceera. 💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaaah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just finished going through comments below n watching. We all make choices in life n you get to live with it. This 3 grown up individuals chose their path n it's their own business. He has come out to share his journey on marriage. Wish them well n who are we to judge.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The court of public opinion. I think it is their own choice... Read(Abraham's choice) to make his business public. Therefore, people will definitely judge."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@msg3211 True. I totally agree n there are many out there that we all don't know or may know. So let everyone carry their cross.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But for Cera it's clear she did not CHOOSE, She simply had no option!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's so uncomfortable to count the number of times the guy had to be Ceras mouth piece. Why answer on her behalf whilst she is there.
Makes you wonder if she really is comfortable in that space or a lot of things are forced on her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart bleeds for Sarah,,she seems not ok wah!! I don't think I can tolerate this😥😥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen Knew exactly what she was about to get her self into.
After she knew Abraham was married with a family, , she still went ahead and had unprotected sex and had herself a baby.
What does that tell you..?? That Maureen had made a plan to just get in between these Cera and Abraham.
Uta tolea aje married man nguo and you are saying you always felt guilty and sorry for Serah..!!!
Aaaaarrrrggggh I hate Maureen!!
May God Open Serah’s eyes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"at first I did not even want to watch, but on second thought I appreciate Abraham for being open. Many men have extra marital affairs and they are not open about it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeh!...I feel for Cera...I pray she heals and moves on...but Abraham is a manipulative  narcissist...pray and fast for detachment....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This interview has just helped serah to know this two people much better than she thought she knew them,i hope after the interview she is viewing this to help know this better, that place is not her home,Abraham is contented with Maureen not Serah,and Serah is pretending,soon she will be feed up with all this.may God help Serah to have the strength to choose herself first, just as Maureen is saying ""do something that makes you feel happy ""Serah should choose herself first."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is a NO-go zone for me. There is no way a human being can love two people equally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Join Islam we Marry upto 4 without worry
q4sWUJxjc4g,Surely kama Si usherati
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please be mine! Youre one in a million...Hahaha
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is a sanitized adultery, nothing else"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Personally am not contented with Abraham ,does it mean that Sera didn't give him whatever he needed??? ....I think even Sera's father upto date has not healed , Abraham find Sera's father and talk to him ..........Maureen u are courageous for bearing with all hatred ,but my question to u is ,why did u accept Abraham knowing that he had Sera????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For us Christians,,this is a topic of discussion,, but Muslims,,this is just something normal,, Abraham is just a gentleman he brought this lady and introduced her to his family,, unlike some hyenas who are just pretenders sleeping with other women outside their marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am lost for words. I am concerned for the kids when they grow up. It can never be the same. Lord have mercy. One year only...woiii...time must tell in this case... Morin is calling her Sarah by the way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wonderful. All the best.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This union of theirs looks like the second wife gets more favoured than the first wife.  The second wife gets to spend more private time with Abraham than Cera considering they work together. I've only heard Abraham saying how the second wife isn't going anywhere and how she's been taking care of Cerah when she was heavily pregnant, what about Cerah? what's good about her apart from being kind enough to let the second wife into their home? does she get to go on private dates with Abraham as the second wife stays at home?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is only good at cleaning his dirty house when he was 'mamamboga,' yes!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Confidently telling us you took your daughters photo down sindio?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also got the impression of A used to "" katakata mboga "" for Sera (sp). 
They met when he wasn't all that well off.
It's a short time but - he gets into another relationship when they ( with S) seem to b doing good ( financially ).
Looks to me he now got the wife of his "" type"" - he mentioned about not being in good terms w S at that time,  M's skin etc.) 
Also S having to find out by herself must have been so painful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is really 💔 broken but she loves a husband too much and the man knows that and took that advantage of her the second woman is old too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sina nguvu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those of you sympathising with Serah...if you watched ""Metha ya kagoni""show serah stated that Abraham  once told him he would come to marry a second wife,so she seemed comfortable and that's why Abraham went a head and married Maureen.Abraham seems to have taken advantage of Serah's kindness.... at times mwanamke ni kutoa fujo am sure if Serah did so the guy wouldn't have married the 2nd one or rather he'd have married but angemficha kama bangi....where I draw the line is bringing her home and staying in the same house anyway the Abraham's lambeni glucose juu safari ni ndefu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same house that's a joke on my side
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In every bad thing  there is a good thing inside of it,thanks cera  for being wise woman, mwaume ni kama mtoto akipenda kitu ata umfanyie nini hawezi acha kuipenda ,kama cera angeacha bwana yake juu ameoa mwanamke mwingine angeenda kulea watoi akiwa peke yake na ata akienda kwa mwanaume mwingine hakuna atakae penda watoto wake kuliko baba yao mzazi,better mwenye ananiambia tuko wawili kuliko mwenye ako na side chick  watano,mbora heshima iko kati yetu na ana provide  am ok with it,master planer hapa ni cera  aliingiza second wife  na Abraham box vizuri  sasa hakuna plan kubwa inaweza fanywa na cera akose kunjua"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let us not glorify sin i.e polygamy is not accepted by God.Abraham according to God's WORD you are wrong to have taken a second wife.You are committing adultery and the wages of adultery is death that is complete separation from the LORD Jesus our creator and saviour.Maureen if you love Jesus and want to make it to heaven you should leave Abraham and his wife Sarah because you are committing fornication.God's word will never change, it is forever established in heaven.The word of God Abraham reminds you that a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his Wife/ not wives and the 2 not 3 shall become one flesh.You betrayed Sarah your wife and you are truly a poor example to the young generation.Abraham this is the epitome of betrayal what happened to you? If you are interested in making it to heaven then ask Maureen to leave Sarah's home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woooi 46:16 waaah nimelia haki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Guys, I am from a dad with 2 wives, my mom being the first. There is more than meets the eye. You are here yapping and seeing that all is well we should not judge. Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches and I can confidently tell you is that it hurts..So much. 😥

Men please, behave yourselves and stick to your EVE. Muache mipango ya kando na hii blended family nonsense. Na nyinyi madem mnaingilia ndoa za watu, may it never go well with you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this family no matter what
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't think it's God's doing the way Abraham said, but I think it's just a case of owning Ur mistakes and trying to sanitize them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,2nd wife na asha take over....? serah aende kwa Pastor Ezekiel...arudishiwe bwana yake....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the guy is manipulative,,,the 1st is in pain they just choose to pretend Infront of camera...sera should just leave those 2...he will regret"
q4sWUJxjc4g,selfishness is selfishly wicked
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those who are asking Lynn what is the moral lessons ,just beat in mind that Lynn is bringing trending issues and matters that concern ppl......big up lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you for clarifying this. I was asking myself the same. I love watching Lynn’s shows as most of them  are educational and inspiring. This one …not sure… i watched till half couldn’t finished , it felt so wrong ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is  well rehearsed interview. Serah ran you are so much better than this. You deserve to be someone’s 1st priority. This guy was not afraid of loosing you. Don’t settle. Can’t finish watching. Thanks Lynn for what you do. Kenyans here in diaspora love you.❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"you right, this guy don't deserve this woman Sarah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Me too couldn't finish watching. 
Disgusting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@TruthTeller4225 sure,even judging with his talk waaah....i just caant"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What do you mean (don't settle) b fair to Serah.And Maureen.What Abraham has done,is done by so many men in secrecy ,but he's come out congrats,to his bold move.To me , whatever has brought them together,may it increase 7 fold.Its better together than far apart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Correct.I found it disgusting too,didn't even watch it to the end.ptho!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"until when women can be married to more than one husband, I will never accept polygamy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My prayers goes out to Sarah, there is no joy in such arrangements. My advice to ladies always keep developing you, love yourself first. This is hurting to Sarah may God open her doors. Their body language is on another level they are just faking it, the one who are trully innocent are Sarah and the kids. Sad to drag people and have no self control, only God gives us self control."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife pack and go live the desrespectiful monster of a man what will tell your children really?????to follow suit?????   I hate to hate men but I hate this monster of a man what is sex really?? First I urge to live you are so beautiful to be mishandled you require your dignity
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy doesn’t love Serah. Serah is too beautiful for this shit. Maureen is an example of a woman who could not stop herself from having a kid with a married man. Even if you love him to the moon and back, if you realize he’s married, release yourself and move on completely. Serah alicheswa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love this family aki.  Sarah and Maureen don't listen to haters who are themselves bleeding inside.  May God bless this sweet family🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. Abraham is blessed man and the guy is really enjoying❤️❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Noni G ....kindly understand nobody is hating on them.
Wrong is wrong even if everybody is doing it and right is right even if nobody is doing it.

We wish them well but we hope nobody has to go through the Betrayal Serah has undergone. Raise your son in an honourable way so that he is disciplined enough to be faithful and your daughter to respect herself and aware of the fact you dont have to prey on another woman's husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@maureenwachira9499 someone is hurting and it's Sarah...it just doesn't heal that fast... moreso, seeing that person who came to destroy your relationship is still living with you under the same roof... Sarah, please take care of yourself emotionally... this might one day work against your health..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@faithwambugu1793 I agree with you
46:16 is our answer
The pain Serah felt explaining how hard it was for her tells it all. All the rest are sideshows."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah deserves to move out of that stupid situationship...I pray she realizes that sooner than later.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah may God fill you with his grace. It is not easy for any woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"With time lets see how much  Abraham can carry, since he is just human he has confessed that it is not easy. Remember that was not God's original design for family.. May God give him long life to see his children grow. But hapo kwa bible hapana........ read more so that you get to really understand what became of generations and what God's will is for family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Here the most special person is Seráh. Because Moureen already new what she was letting her self  in. The person to be protected is Serah. She is a wonderfull person. She had to look beyond her feeling.  Abrahm this is not about Moureen. It's about Serah. Good luck.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man is a narcissistic and Maureen is a selfish woman.May God see you through Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,God forbid!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn much love sweetheart, you are also a gorgeous soul just like Sarah and Maureen❤️❤️❤️.  The thing is, these are three people with very clean hearts and very genuine.  I pray for you guys to stay strong and live together forever happy.  God bless Sarah and Abraham for protecting Maureen.  Abraham is a blessed man with two gorgeous women❤️❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why do people assume that there's betrayal or someone is feeling the pain knowing that they mention that they are happy in arrangements they have. Whoever have 2 husbands or vice versa is up to themselves. They seem happy and if not they will go separate ways since they are all able to make right decisions on their own.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceera looks younger than maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,*I'LL MARRY 2 WIVES*
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lovely Family 🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good content Lyn keep It up
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its nice that he is open with the whole arrangement than hiding everyday.  God bless their family. Its not for everybody...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is the most beautiful...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Taking care of one wife is A project .. can only imagine Taking care of 2.. 😢. 
This my Take After 16 years of Marriage. A woman Was created to be Loves. Actually God commanded man to Love the Wife as Christ loved the Church and gave out his only son to same the church.
Women thrive in Love. 
To a Woman Love is spelt as T I M E. she desires your time, your attention. You may not be perfect but her heart is full when she knows she can count on u.
A marriage ain't ment for men but for Both.. 
Infact of truth be said.. she the Marriage is for her more than for us the men.
She is the owner of the House.
She gives birth to the Children,
She is the wings behind the Children's..
If mummy ain't happy no one is Happy..
A Woman gives to much, energy, emotion and even her life while giving birth for the Marriage.....
For heavens sake.. ENJOY YOUR YOUTH WITH THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Saddists and bitter people Wanaumwa seeing this happy beautiful family and united.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waah,Cerah you are a woman of substance ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The way u refer to them as sasa huyuuuu....sasa hawaaaa.....🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am better single this nonsense i can't entertain never. Hugs Sera this people are just taking advantage of you, they are not even giving her time to talk. God will fight for you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Facts, there is no happiness here. I feel for Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I've always said, people take advantage of wapole, humble people. Sera, I'm waiting to hear from you when you hit age 40. Macho hufunguka 😳😳. 
Lynn told us not to judge but I'm soo judging 🧐. 
Abraham is a very selfish dude who is trampling on the softy Serah. 
Maureen is a very willing accomplice of Abraham.  She had studied the guy and knew he'll not leave her once a kid is in the picture. Then oops, a baby happens! Give Serah a break from both of you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly the Lord Jesus Christ will for marriage s will never change,one wife ,one husband. Am only here because l want to understand how it works for them and learn something from the story so that the future generation will not end up like this but it's also powerful that they are not fighting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,what about a third wife Abraham?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yuck. Hii.. haiwezekani.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is a smart woman but she got desperate. Does she really think he is not going to go out again and get a 3rd & 4th? Serah, may God heal you in the places you don't even talk about."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Things happening in this country in the name of western cultures are so wierd ..Sasa mtu ata anatoa wapi nguvu ya kuharibu boma ya mwenzake....nkt!! cera may hide but truth be told jealous,stress,denial n many more are ailing her personally this is a big NO! to me...pata nguvu utoe mtu kwa space yako mummie"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you Lynn for asking the right questions👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Did it really ""sink in akazoea"" as put by Maureen or was Sarah threatened by Abraham about going away without her kids 🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would prefer being in Maureen's shoes rather than Serah's..watching my husband bring another woman onto our lives after 8 years of marriage...its humiliating..no joy in that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The most important point is that there is no victim here! The situation works for all three and to some extent the children too.
Abraham for whatever reason, pure or not gets to conveniently have two wives.
Cera still has the man she loves and her kids have their dad.
Maureen is no longer a thorn, she has been crowned. The dynamic works!  it’s not about love and respect. The day one of them will stop getting what they need, the empire crumbles"
q4sWUJxjc4g,👏👏👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is a victim of this man's greed!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is obviously alot of love in this home , all the best to them who are we to judge , all the Best the Abraham's"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You look nice with short natural black hair Lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,No even though they said we shouldn't judge this I must judge...I can't imagine this Never it's better to be single period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't know but I think Maureen is a big pretender..I don't feel her vibes at all at all,fact remains she wrecked another woman's home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is not a good man
q4sWUJxjc4g,The trauma 💔 😢. Ata kama Maureen anajaribu kuficha. The feeling says it all yani anaumia ndani ni venye she has to cooperate with whatever is going on 🥴
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen's final remarks are not right. Leave married men alone. Ala!🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is in pain her physical appearance can tell...1 1/2 its nt enough to say that he is ok..betrayal, denial this thing is painful..1day cera will move she is not happy at all may God grant her enough peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah's eyes display pain. She is learning what these guys were doing behind her back. Maureen has lied that she didn't know this guy was married.  It's really a pity.
q4sWUJxjc4g,But she corrected her mistake
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is a beautiful woman  , mature and intelligent. This man has hurt serah ,he has no clue what a wonderful woman Serah is."
q4sWUJxjc4g,N what if a third woman comes in the picture the same way??
q4sWUJxjc4g,This lady is seriously hurt…i think she’s just there for the kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki this is bullshit….God!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Now this is polyandry
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love your questions lynn ngugi ypu are so talented in this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nice interview... Inawezekana hakuna cha ajabu..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men are soooo selfish. Serah had alot to cater for.....watoto, job, wewe and herself then you marry because of those lame excuses ati hakua na time yako ???"
q4sWUJxjc4g,To say my truth l dont support such…….this is nonsense there is one who is suffering inside. Thats my thinking. Take it or leave it……..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sad for sera. She just has to hang onto a man who is more attracted to another woman right infront of her face. Maureen should also have known her worth and get herself her own man instead of holding onto a man who has a wofe for financial stability. I wish both women would know their worth
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sadly I feel like cerah never really gets to talk about how she feels,like she speaks as if she is walking on eggshells,she compliments Abraham more and he doesn't reciprocate it😩"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"On point
This is one of the most absurd interview considering the time we are in.One day Sellar will walk out of this.She is such honourable lady and doesn't need to go through this.The other lady..... have no words"
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham God will punish you  both with your second wife she had a right to say no  and she  isnot guilty wacera she's to young to be betrayed ladies leave married men alone .
q4sWUJxjc4g,I blame wazazi why do they agree
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Abraham has symptoms of even marrying a third and fourth wife !!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn I watch and appreciate all your shows except what you are showing here 
What do you think the generations younger than them are learning, they could be finding it working now but imagine the children after they are grown and understanding the differences that may start to appear from the noise the world will offer.
Are you trying to introduce polygamy??
Is this morally upright? Is it God’s will or agenda do you observe life in another ten or so years to come, he says there are no challenges, yes now!! but does he think in his absence how would things be in future?? is this trying to encourage youths to try infidelity?? Where is this taking us???
Painting or cosmeticking wrong doesn’t make it right 🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine this is wrong. Unakuta watu wamejijenga halafu unaingilia kati. God forbid aki.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are we going to ignore the part where he said he loves light skin ladies and clearly Cera is not light skin. 🤭 I think akikata skuma type yake ilikua Cera. Venye alipata pesa diet ikachange akaona sasa ametosha mboga kuafford light skin. What a narcissist!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very amazing bt as time pass by you should make sure evey wife have something by their names and children to avoid argument when you  become old🥰🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I watch this story , and I ask myself;;
1. what if it was the other way around ?
2. Would he have accepted to share? 
Anyway life happens 😰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The hug part was beautiful..awww..🥰🥰..if u are a man and ur wives wanapendana hivi umenaswa,upende usipende..dont even dare hurt them.i love them.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those things are going on in homes everyday  , it's just that Sera  decided to not fight . But submit  to the situation instead  of quarreling daily   .   I have a brother whose has a side woman  for over 10 years . And I tell you his wife is never happy  for all these years."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel so sorry for Sera aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Maureen I lack words for her,she broke Sera's marriage but she's no blinking,yaani hajali simpendi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,SERA is true meaning of super  woman🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn leo umaniweza nikaa nawatch full movie
q4sWUJxjc4g,Personally i don't see any problem...if they are all happy who am to judge
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My darling husband wherever you are and if u will one day come across this ,just stick with me coz I give u the best and I love u"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think this the way to go wamama ni wengi hapa Kenya we need to share every woman need a man in her life
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hate to see this Abraham guy. He's so proud.This is disgraceful. Oh God...heal souls here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure madness. I don't know but..........
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife for me🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Lynn Ngugi question 🤔 it on point good job 👏 👍 Respect it the key to everything 👏 👌  👏 👍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My two cents from a psychologist point of view,If Abraham married a third wife,Maureen would leave"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Absolutely
💯"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He did say love is 'UNLIMITED' and not unconditional so  it's  possible 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I would say this is a selfish man! First of all, he disrespected the first wife and he was NEVER remorseful! The first wife is deep heart from her heart! I’m sure she will walk out one day. Such a user and toxic guy. So do they involve on three-some sex ama🤣🤣🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera has a big heart ,,,am just imagine if it were me heeee 😂😂 I can't take this bwana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The audacity!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What kind of madness is this😳let each woman have her own house,fika bei baba
The thought of your husband having intimacy with another woman in the next room is so traumatizing nkt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The best I love is Lyn's tact of interviewing and humor
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is detestable.  How is this even possible?  May God come for you Cerah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Will the children grow thinking that this is normal? What are the values you are instilling to your children? It is the high time we stopped normalising  immorality. Cerah wake up, smell the coffee and get out of this toxic marriage for the sake of your children and the generations to come. The earlier the better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True... questions am having in mind she asked all of them kudos Lynn 👏👏👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is total madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki God should give cerah alot of strength coz she is stomaching alot. These two narcissistic fellows are taking advantage of her goodness without her knowledge.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We all deserve undivided love.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Marriage is between one man and one woman,  🙏🙏🇰🇪🇰🇪🇺🇸🇺🇸"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Two narcissists versus one empath. may the empath win. behind the loud laughter there's a lot they are masking esp pain. but to each their own. I'm not inspired by this story. nothing to emulate. Soo sorry for Serah. it's all about the needs of the male narcissist.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry to say but Maureen is a good pretender..I understand serah maybe hakutaka kumloose Abraham ikabidi amekubali..but serah deep down she has something
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah, hugs. Ur someone's prayer item"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love how Maureen was speechless when asked why she proceeded to even have a baby despite knowing he had a family 😮. Ladies we are so strong, yaani you can date a man you met akikata mboga waah then after struggling he has a sidechick. This family is so young. I believe the man is greedy and thinks he is so hot. Abraham, kudos. I know you are already dating your prospective 3rd wife somewhere. Hutakosa, light skin ni wengi utapata. Maureen, stop calling her Sarah and say Cera the way she has explained and may God strike you properly. Cera,  my heart goes out to you. You are very strong for staying with a harlot as a second wife. Grace to you. It must not be easy. I will buy the book you'll write one day"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is a rare breed this is too much for a woman I am an advocate of one husband one wife there's no need to subject your 1st wife to this I guess separate homes will do them good no woman likes sharing her man this is so wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The 1st wife is the one with a heart of gold. That's my opinion anyway.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is quite shameless,it’s the audacity for me.Abraham is heartless /typical narcissist and is evident he loves Maureen more.Sera has a low self esteem and is still in denial"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yap.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how Maureen wants to put it, she is a home wrecker! And Abraham is a cheat , if he had intentions of having a second wife, he would have communicated with his first wife initially before they even got married and not have a child outside his marriage to validate his having a second wife.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how we try to sugar-coat this is sin and will never be right in God's eyes. Isaiah 5:20 says Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Third parties in marriage are never in love but lust and living in sin. Please Cera do not be partaker of your husband's sin by condoning his wrong move, he betrayed you and this is what it is. It is better to suffer alone than to live in the pain of betrayal. I'm not a sychologist but it is quite visible that Cera is hurting inside, no woman will ever want to share her husband with another and furthermore living in the same house, it is not normal, you live in such a torment and grieving inside no matter how you try to block it. I'm sure Cera has no choice though It's like living in hell. My prayer to you Cera is that God gives you divine understanding to know what to do but as for now may you continually be endowed with supernatural peace and sufficient grace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Serah is suffering silently coz  Abraham betrayed her.Maureen knew the guy was married and accepting coffee dates and even getting a kid wasn't right at all.what were her intentions.Abraham according to Serah had thrown her away make time for Maureen and give excuses of not being able to go home.I have listened to their story and for sure I pray for Serah.Yiu don't have to live with a man who tells you that he has a mistress n a child. This is infidelity and divorce is allowed. I wish you stood your ground and left him to marry the mistress.This is being a narcissist where you hurt a person emotionally and want them to live with you coz of kids.i don't support this. Maureen should stay away n live her life.Two women in the same house it's a no no ..Serah there was no respect from Abraham n I don't see love here.serah loves the guy but the guy loves Maureen and they are always together working while serah is home.i could see her pain.sharing a man in the same house hurts a lot. .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@lynn Ngugi you need to have talk with serah please,, this woman is in pain but it's hard for her to speak out ,wooii Jesu I feel sorry to her"

q4sWUJxjc4g,No comment
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After listening to how this thing came about to be, he could just have apologised to Cera and given her credit for the family he so proud of. Cera you are just a wonderful creature and may God c you thru all this for giving Maureen a shelter."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A similar situation nearly happened to me. A man i thought was mine alone  for 8 years turned up back home after two weeks away with a wedding ring. When i became hysterical he calmly took the ring off and asked what the problem was. What did the ring change? I thought i loved him so much he could crap all over me. he even said that he would introduce me to the new wife. Really?
 i thought i was the one going mad. I hurt, i ached i broke down but after 4 hours talking. I told him that it was the last time he would enter my house. Never saw him again.

 I now have someone younger than him, lovelier, kinder and with whom i have been and experienced things i never did with him.
 If only i could give Sarah that confidence to walk away. She is so beautiful inside and out. I am not convinced  Abraham has finished. there will be more women. Infact i belive he was ready to leave Serah if she hadnt accepted. More madharau is coming. Wake up my girl. that 'Co wife?' she knew he was taken. Stop enabling them. Serah drives, works is strong. Get up. You deserve better. It will be hard but you have  family and friends that love you. God and your two hands to work. If you walk out believe me they may last for abit and then they too will crumble. 
Think of your kids. What are you teaching them?Would you want this for them?
Allow Abraham to see his kids no problem. Be a friend to your co wife but go start a healthy normal life. Be selfish. Love yourself and your kids. Wake up. We are all egging you on. All of us who cant say so face to face but want better for you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree...and he told her as much.. remember he said ""Maureen is not going anywhere"" meaning? If anyone must go Its Sera to go."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah looks sad .By the looks she was forced to accept the other  woman good thing is it’s still young love so they can go apart .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's the way he described Maureen, efficient, beauutful wen it comes to Sarah it's the lady in heels?? Sarah is even strong to seat kwa ii interview and do it, I can't have that grace the betrayal could not allow me seat down even sharing the same house... But instead of cheating Sarah hakupe time I thought pple shld talk n buld it... Women we go thru alot
I have no idea why he's laughing
N how did Maureen not know his not married am not believing it anyway I hope they are happy as Wana onyesha... Like this guy has a ring unless alikuwa ana toa wen his with Maureen, it's so ironic how she keeps saying how about Sarah what does Sarah think... If Sarah was at the back of her mind ata iyo romance n going out for coffee Maureen wld have backed out... Anyway am not judging but weeeuh God yutupea grace to face some situations"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife has so much pride in her.....

q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera's voice tells it all outing up with this betrayal it's too much.. I think this is not something to be happy about and for me no one should be encouraging this.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"All rich men must have more women.......


Poor men always we have one praying to be rich sometimes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that Maureen chose to be intimate with Abraham knowing way too well that he was married makes her guilty of taking Cerah through the pain she went through after she knew her husband has sired a kid out of their marriage and he didn't even have the courtesy to tell her,so she agreed not because she wanted to buy for the sake of the kid,her kids who missed their dad when he was away in Maureen's house and Cerah who would hardly see him cz anarandaranda nje ako njiani akitoka Kwa Maureen,the two should apologise to Cerah,they both are guilty...anyway since the mistake happened and cnt be reversed I'd give u some credit for taking care of them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is unhappy......
Maureen is guilty......

q4sWUJxjc4g,he was just using Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,The three carry the burden themselves
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The entire interview is about what Maureen would do or say. Nothing about Serah. I am so hurt on her behalf aki. The truth is Abraham already stopped loving Serah but maybe he can't leave her coz of one thing or another. It is only Maureenm who is being defended and Abraham saying she is not going anywhere. It sounds like Sarah can go if she wants, but Maureen is protected"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I might not know a lot but this noooo... Someone here is hurting and it's not M or A... God heal whatever and whoever needs this... Manipulative rlsh....

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why is no one talking about how sly this Abraham is,he will bring in 4 more wives…."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Watching this space 🤔🤔🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lived happily never after. would Maureen accept the third wife? God bless the children .
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I can say is that in marriage it's abt how u put yourself in that marriage  some men can't try this nonsense coz they know their wives breath fire it's either u die early uwaache ama u loose both of them n yr life become miserable
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Okay, but for the sake  of 10 or more years to come, it's wise each woman to have their separate home . So as to give each of them room to create their own wealth when they are still young and healthy.
Sera, its good you accepted a co wife instead instead of keeping on fighting back. This helped alot in your healing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is sick. I feel so much for cerah 💔. May God give her the strength to walk away from this madness!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati mlisema hio emoji ya wueeeh iko🤔😳
q4sWUJxjc4g,In my opinion Serah is just pretending to be okay.Her body language tells it all.You can never love to people at the same time.Period
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love Lynn's questions you are just amazing 😍😍 I love you sister 😘😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The question I have,it is one thing to sleep with someone's husband ,but getting pregnant and carrying it to full term,what was going through Maureen's mind.Mpango yake ilikuwa?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy yes but with a will defining the future if one dies.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen hujafanya poa yaani your mum is okay you doing such to another woman😭😭😭😭I can't imagine what sera is going thru imagine hearing your husband banging another lady in your house🥺🥺🥺sera may God open a way n give you strength to walk away out of these nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The moment you blocked him Maureen,it should have remained that way…Cerah,you should leave ,you are beautiful and can make it by yourself!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, u forced Sarah into accepting because u said u won't leave her. Selfish man. 
Sarah had no choice anyway. Hatoki kwake ndio maana akasongeza goalpost akamleta kwa nyumba. Kwani watoto na tunatokaga nao na baba mtoto asiwai waona"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a story I don't think I would want to share my man with another woman because it's really not easy,but am happy for them because of their honesty 😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham wake up man it's very clear that Cera is hurting so bad am really sorry for this girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,A woman who cannot accommodate or have space for a co-wife whether she is there or not cannot be a first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love the part when Cerah starts with mapenzi wewe then holds Abraham's hand...so beautiful 😍..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Lynn from all the way in South Africa... Love you & your show.

I'm still listening just got disturbed by Maureen saying she got confused in another interview whether or not Abraham was married.. There's no way you can be confused over such & in all the coffee meetings nothing red flags for her that this guy might be a family guy. I'm not buying her story on this one & while she was enjoying the attention why didn't she ask the right questions when she she realised guy is vibe🤷🏻‍♀️ before the deep end"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is so selfish very very selfish all about him nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah is the woman of the house for Abraham.Yule mama wa kulinda boma.
Maureen is the love of his life.He loves maureen but Cerah amekaa tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is extremely beautiful both inside out. May God of restoration restore Sarah's marriage.
At first maureen felt guilty not because she is human but because deep down she knows what she did was wrong. Yes a child was born but 2 wrongs don't make a right.They say our God is so miraculous I pray Maureen get her own husband huyu sio wake."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi I'll never subscribe to this kind of bullshit. I'll just walk away
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is what holds all this together..but the honour went to the second wife! Halafu mnasema hajafinywa...anyway as long as she is okay with that....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So if sera was that good for you, respectful bla bla..why did you went ahead and get another woman.. . This guy is hurting sera, may sera find happiness  elsewhere... I just don't like his perspective at all.. 😞😞😞 Sera is deeply hurt as much as she doesn't want to admitt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I pray to God this is not my potion as a mother of three God fearing, handsome and successful sons. I could not finish watching this show"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the small snippets I had seen earlier on this couple(s), I expected the guy to be waaaay much older. Well, let people be. The narrative has earlier been, if you don't have money and can't take care of more than two families,then don't be a polygamist. Now,here is a guy who appears financialy, mentally, psychologicaly able to take care of two families, but still people (outsiders)are finding fault."
q4sWUJxjc4g,May sera leave this rubbish of a situationship!pthoooo warrathissss! And i can just tell this guy is cheating out there! He will surely bring a 3rd wife or even 4th 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is heartbreaking and disgusting there's is nothing to be proud of here 
Hugs to serah because this is high level of betrayal 😔   its a shame 😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I thought this second wife is a young girl..gosh she looks washed out and old  than serah ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At the moment Abraham feels like the king, but in old age, Abraham will be made an option by his kids. Each kid will take care of their mom 1st. The women know what they are doing. What goes around, comes around. The same eyes will see another young woman and it will hurt Maureen. Sarah will have ""peace"" knowing Maureen will be policing ""her man"" and never have peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,His heart goes for Moreen.....oh my dear Sarah may God open her inner eyes
q4sWUJxjc4g,My sister. 2nd wife. I thnk u shld hv jus divorced this guy n get your own. To b honest reading Sarah face she ws only forced to accept ths by th. Situation. Sarah. You are beautiful. Maureen plz zzz respect ths woman shez your queen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waah so hapa ndo mapenzi imetufikisha🙌 personally hii arrangement will never register on my mind.. The bible said so ratio 1>7 🤔🤔🤔🤔 This man is so canal, narcissistic 🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I fear this union but if it is working for them then kudos.why do I fear it.it is from a very traumatizing union like this of my mum's friend .the husband married a second wife and all the lavidavis went on for a good size years.one day this second wife took a hoe and pretended to be going to the garden passing by the first wife.she turned back and dug into her head.she went to jail but left this first wife hospitalised for a year who later died blind,deaf and dump.just a cabbage.but I said ,kudos to them if it works for them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By choosing Maureen he unchose* Serah. Reality is, if Serah left he would have stayed with Maureen, if Maureen left he would have chased after her. The facts are, Serah wasn’t enough for him."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad truth
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said

q4sWUJxjc4g,"For real we can all see there's a problem here, Cera is btwn a rock and a hard place. Numbing is Cera's coping mechanism, (seems she tried to talk to Abraham but nothing was changing and she went numb)

q4sWUJxjc4g,Mama pendo is more far beautiful and younger than Maureen why did Abraham and to do this to serah

q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's a two way thing.Women are actually more polyamorous in nature, ni Ile huwa hawapayuki kila mahali.If you didn't know,now you know! Actually very serious!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I've alot to say but let me reserve my comment for now,but hapa hakuna ndowa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaaaiii nyie reke nemwo
q4sWUJxjc4g,46:09.  True discription of cerah's emotions.but she accepted and found happiness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yee..that tsk sound is full of pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very painful experience from Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I could feel it
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let's not get it twisted guys. This is NOT a match made in heaven. This is sugar-coated infidelity. God's plan for marriage is one man, one woman period! You know the truth but you ignore it and suppress it. Wacheni chocha."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm sorry I can't finish this interview 😔 My God I feel Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, this guy is one in a million. Serah has a golden heart!!  If many women are like her, these things can work. If men were to be honest, they have sired kids outside marriage but keep hiding for the sake of their goat wives and goat children. Through Abraham's arrangement, the society can curb an increase of single parents and children with absentee fathers. There will also be less divorce cases, less deaths through abortions and depression, as well as minimal domestic violence. All these are factors caused by infidelity famously known as ""mpango wa kando."""
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are you a second wife? Or a single mum?
q4sWUJxjc4g,The solution is for women to stop having kids with these men...not for women to allow this bs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This story is just sad and miserable. They can't even speak to justify themselves well. I feel for Serah, the Lord will give you joy and peace again. 
Every wife's biggest fear is a cheating husband.
And for him 'cheating husband' to bring his girlfriend into their home is disrespectful and a ticking time bomb. 
This man was just married for few years and already cheating. 
I salute the men that control and respect themselves and their wife, your favour will be greater. 
We cannot glorify your cheating. 

Young ladies love and respect yourselves enough to walk away from married men and find your own man. There is no beauty or dignity in wanting a man that doesn't belong to you. 
Great job interviewing Ms LN as usual..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story has blank spaces to be filled.Sera has a heart that no one else has.Prepare and leave them you are the odd one out this bracket
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@annmaiyo3135 
Ann what you wouldn't wish for yourself or your children don't wish for others.
Serah has simply accepted the situation because it is what it is, not that she's OK with it. Read between the lines."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah your beautiful this Man does not deserve you!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah,the grace of God will keep you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can never be serah,I refuse in jesus name .
Women, empower your girls ..ni hayo tu kwa sasa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I highly encourage families in Kenya to build families like this from the start before having kids , it best for a  strong support network. I have seen very successful polygamous families in Kenya and America. It's a new trend  that's coming back . In the future it's important to have two wives instead of baby mamas"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just marry 10 even but don't lie to anyone that it's a trend. Must women be married in the first place? Which families are you advising? Which world do you live in? People are choosing singlehood and you're here lying about polygamy?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@hadassahhadassah1479 it's not a must to get married but it helps with the continuity of humanity, having a polygamy family helps build a strong support network for the family or makes the family very successful. It's not too late get married out there am sure you will find your match , you can join a family or find a partner and build a family and add another woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is all about Baba Abraham's happiness ! And he's paying for it dearly. But if they are happy who are we ???Thanks Lynn for bringing this! Quenched my curiosity.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is ADULTERY in hiding. God hates adultery. Marrying another woman while you're already married is called ADULTERY. This generation needs to repent and go back to God. Jesus is coming soon. Without Holiness no one will see God. Repentance is the way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weuuuh!. The selfishness and entitlement in this man. Lady open your eyes. Serah, this man does not value you.

Maureen found a safety net. She didn't have to build from scratch. She has mastered the right words to say to keep herself anchored here. Of course your children are a part of this plan"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a sad life and such a pathetically manipulative guy!
How can he be so heartless after all that faithfulness and love he got from Sarah?
How many more women and children is he yet to introduce?
Since he talks about looking beyond love, can he allow them to look beyond love and have other men too on the side?

My opinion is that he’s just a selfish man who cares about himself and no one else. Seeing Sarah in such a situation is just so very painful and I pity her poor life. 
Enough with society allowing men to oppress women!! He’s emotionally abused Sarah and he’s proud to continue abusing her for the rest of her life. I wish Sarah at some point will come to realize that love is not meant to be a prison, you deserve much much better!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"THIS STORY IS FULL OF MANIPULATION, BRAIN WASHING, BETRAYAL.  2 BEAUTIFUL WOMEN TAKE ADVANTAGE BY A NARCISSISTIC MEN THAT HAVE NO RESPECT FOR A WOMEN FEELINGS MAURINEEN SORRY FOR ATTENDING THAT COFFEE CLUB WITH A MARRIED MAN."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Are want to tell us God did the mistakes as he creat Adam and Eve  because after he could creat another  woman, just we wait and see they was other woman whom came to apologise for been in other ones family so Morin let wait time will tell"
q4sWUJxjc4g,To each their own. Lynn you did a great job staying bipartisan.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It all start from how first wife treats husband.serah is the problem
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is so beautiful.May God fill her heart with divine peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,She actually looks like Abraham. The real Rib.
q4sWUJxjc4g,it is wat it is only God's grace is needed. bt know that wat u plant today will affect ur generation..Abraham u v planted a seed that u will reap one day..so be careful n prayerful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me be thinned by my own lakini am so bitter at father Abraham’s selfishness 😟
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me be thinned by my own lakini am so bitter at father Abraham’s selfishness 😟
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So nobody is going to talk about Abraham ""ladish"" phy4 tucharacteristics!!!
Sio dimples Mara kuramba lips after every 2 seconds!anyway that's on a light nite.
Thank God all these people are all grown ups, only they know why they are doing whatever this is and why they would keep up with this ""Sherade"" it's exaughting! My goodness!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham from Hell' the patriarch ABRAHAM  committed the Sin of Bigamy coz he wanted a Kid. But this Hellish abraham commit it willfully because of Lust lol'
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Bible says whatever comes between two people is death
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am I the only one  who can't do this . I would rather walk out
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes to Serah, she is masking alot"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man is mean and it seems he is in love with the second woman.as for sarah she says na wewe"" si unajua??but affirms maureen uaing her names...his heart is in maureen's."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let’s see if one this women come home and tell him l meet a man and have fallen in love and l’m going to bring him home. You will see he will explode.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham there is no woman on earth who likes a norther woman behind her. You have already disappointed your family and your father Inlaw's family . The Bible says one man one Wife. Behind your wives each has something in her they will not say but it is secret in there hearts.  Your second wife is just a nanny in your house not a wife read about Abraham in the Bible.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At this point Lynn..lemi read comments .....did Zuckerberg get us the emoji for ""weeeeuh .."" coz weeeeeeuh🙌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waoh what a wonderful family keep the fire burning I love it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a leader...showing other men not to neglect their children..i respect the two women too much '
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder how  Maureen  feels  when  Sera explain the far they have come  from the Bible  calls her death  this are  the  end time when  bad will be cheered 🍻 🤔  it's not okay never will  it be
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My friend!!!!! Hizi ma ""English"" zenyu Mingi I hope mta maintain Bibi Wa tatu Na wa nne wakiletwa. I speak out of experience because I come from a polligamous home. My late mum was the first wife married in a holy matrimony in 1973 in Kapsabet. 10 years later my late father introduced the snake that came to bite our home n happiness n that's what cut his life short n even robed me of a dad. So my father died when I was only 4yrs. In short I've grown up an orphan  n went thru hell because of my father's foolish decisions. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Serah, you remind me of my late mum (who actually transitioned 3yrs back), she had your kind of mindset n even alisomesha watoto wa huyo nyoka wote watano after my father died in 1998. Watoto wa nyoka Ni nyoka tu. These children came back to bite the very hand that fed them n they have all the audacity in the world. My dear Serah, God is not deceived or mocked n He won't change His principals because of you in as much as He loves you. In His infinite love n rich mercy, He has put His word above His name n there is nothing God honours more than His word. That said, the 3 of you don't you dare think you can out-smart God. If He says in 1st Corr 7:1-end, you think you are going to make the word appear like false. Think again. The snake only sheds it's skin to become a bigger snake 🐍. This Abraham guy amekudhalilisha Na ametukana uke wako. N because you have given him all the honours, he will continue to do it again and again and again. I hope you will still maintain your composure like you're pretending now. In life I have come to learn that you can lie to everyone but you can't lie to God, yourself n the devil 😈. Alafu to top it all up you are allowing the snake to brood in your own matrimonial home under your own nose. Once the tu-small snakes grow big n in partnership with their then python of a mum come to swallow you, the devil 😈 will be sitting down to take notes. Let me tell you something Maina.....sorry Lynn, the masses will be here when these three hypocrites will be busy washing their dirty linens in the public when the pervert Abraham will have introduced snake no.3 & probably 4. God help me Cynthia I will be sipping my coffee as I enjoy the Afro-cinema. 
Lynn I love you n your interviewing skills. Btw don't forget the problem we have today with the Muslim n Alshabaab against us Christians was because of such nonsense. Forget about the three-some that they might be enjoying in the bed or whatever disgusting thing the pervert Abraham is here all smiling about. God have mercy on him. Nakutumia tu watoto wa Serah.😭😭😭😭😭😭 I would have been a journalist were it not for the snake in my father's house but isuru, napata riziki nikiwa Fashion Designer Huku Ruiru. Mob love."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera and Maureen were just chilling then BOOM, here comes another girl who’s pregnant and she ain’t going nowhere! Whatchu gonna do??? 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please this family is doing gud congratulations man your doing the right thing bro 👍👍 it's good to be real than these men who pretend to Mary one woman yet there ever in lodge pretending my self l believe in polygamy
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are both mine!! Wooow
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hope I die before I believe in this ugly lie of ""I love you both""😂😂😂😂 true scam my sisters; don't let this man feed his ego at the expense of your dignity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Increase the volume dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I’m sending hugs and love ❤️ to Serah.My God she is so cute.She is in deep pain and Abraham knows so.Maureen looks sad,unhappy and nervous.This is because she is guilty.This honeymoon won’t last for long.How could you move to another woman’s home at this time and century?Who does that!!
Come on think straight girl.
Serah get a marriage certificate soonest.Love you girl 😘you need your SPACE."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes Mourine carries a sense of guilt even her face shows it .As much as she says she loves  Abraham and she is happy  it's not comfortable loving a man who has another woman Mourine is the solution to this situation if she chose to leave
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Jane Mwangi she looks old  than Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,That she doesn't even go to work nowadays....she brought this on herself by allowing herself to move to Cera's home...who in their right senses does that
q4sWUJxjc4g,@ Lynn ngigi. I looooove u so much. Try to trim introductions..... please
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I noticed something when Lynn asked whether of them feels ignored, Cerah said, ""Many times i beckon Abraham to pay attention to me"".  That says a lot on how the two get lost in their world until she feels so forgotten! And again, they go to work together leaving her at home. Begs the question, how many more coffee's/lunch talks do they do while  she in the house tending to the kids?  Cerah continues to say, ""I wanted to meet Maureen because, Abraham used to speak so high about her""! Weuweh!!?
 How much do they talk & share in her absentia? Pardon my wild thoughts...mie ni binadamu tu."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What Maureen does at Abraham's work place is something Cerah could as well do. She was an accessories sales agent not an IT guru but somehow Abraham wants to deceive us how instrumental Maureen is to the business.. Maureen fascinates him more and it's evident in the video but sadly Cerah is in denial .... Hardly will a man tell you it's over especially now that he stands to lose nothing. I feel for Cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,@simo she's a stranger btn the two  I wish she can open her eyes 👀
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It’s almost like Serah is married to both Abraham and Maureen. And she’s their house wife who stays home with the kids, while they go to work, and bring the money."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Wakinyua This whole story breaks my heart. I feel for Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Unbelievable! Speaking highly about your side chick to your wife?? Abraham took advantage of Cerah kindness and personality.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is so cute and smart atapata watatu tu 🤣😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't look happy!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mapenzi wewe!!!serah Kikulacho ki.......,,,,na huyu kuku alishamwanga mtama kitambo,,av noticed hata vile wameshikana look at father Abraham's hand its says t all.serah kindly open yuor 👀 dya."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for the first wife she is hurt deep down and just pretending to be fine, leave that toxic marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sending hugs to Sarah  maureen. Abraham  and the children  may G0D  protect you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,A third wife is on the way just like the way he brought a second one ask the pschologist and other professionals
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is relatively young in age but I am impressed about how his level of maturity!! Taking responsibility for mistakes and agreeing to work things i say hongera👏,The 3 of u seem to have carried yourselves with alot of grace and maturity to be at this level, agreeing to work out things in a way that's acceptable to all of you all is double 👍👏👏👏👏,now, please stop thinking/worrying about the society and haters! I am so proud of all of u for living your truth instead of undercover!  Mungu awabariki muishi vyema!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,the pain of watching your husband describe how beautiful another woman is...😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ha ha haa, intorelable!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Anasema vile anapenda light skin wueeh😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,It shows total lack of respect for Serah. He diesn’t care that his words are hurtful to her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So painful, as for me I just can't take it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Inauma kos anakuonyesha kuna mzuri kukuliko
q4sWUJxjc4g,That guy looks like he’s going to bring in another woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lol this is a no…Sera should know her worth. The guy is a walking red flag…
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel sorry for those innocent kids they will go up confused!
q4sWUJxjc4g,If pretending was a person.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn is an excellent journalist
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All said and done,,sera you've degraded yourself,,Abraham doesn't deserve you, hakuogopa kukulose"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@LNS hebu tuletee "" the wanjohi queens"" too, unfortunately on their channel they speak Kikuyu so I 'float' like some may also be, they seem to be enjoying such a beautiful relationship, ningependa kuwasikia hapa please."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"how do you wake up at 9😂😂😂 we are not in a hurry, 😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My heart goes out to Serah... All the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,I now understand Sarah she was afraid of loosing her family and so she had to tag around..her patting short words says it all she's never been lucky in life and her only luck was Abraham she was scared of leaving him and had to accept everything..Abraham took advantage of her weakness...Never let someone know everything about your life they will use it against you one day or take advantage of you using it..Abraham and Maureen no matter the sugar coat you did this to Sara 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"yeah..the last part says alot...
& in as much as she tries to say am oky..dats a lie"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Behind the Marriage Mask. Cera is hurting behind the mask.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So @LyneNgugi this remind me of my Situation right now. One day I will get to tell my story here. And for Serra I know what she is going through. She is not happy at all but sometimes people get to do things they have to do. When children are involved its always hard to make descisions and not to be selfish at the same time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is suffering the pain is evident..what are we to understand anyway..girls empowerment needed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I loved this episode.  Reading the comments, it seems that Kenyan women don't want to believe that women in a polygamous marriage can never be happy, should never happy, must not be allowed to be happy. Their natural instinit is to think that the first wife is faking, It is possible for a man to love more than two women but not the same way - many religions have proved that its possble."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women don't want to believe? Clearly women are saying one thing but you choose to believe otherwise. Women are saying polygamy doesn't work for them but you don't want to listen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Psychology fact: A man will tend to stay/spend more time with the woman with a weak mind.Why?You all obviously know. Just observe them even at the workplace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They live in the same house?! Noooo, what are the sleeping arrangements? Noooo this is sad."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen's selfish interests has kept her in this marriage, huyu Abraham akirudi kukata mboga saizi...Sera will be there for him but not Maureen home wrecker.Maureen tafuta Maureen yako."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah loves Abraham, but Abraham loves Maureen, he took the greatest risk for her not caring Sarah's feelings according to his words he'll protect her with his life.If Sarah has chosen this life for herself, who are we?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Do if Serah never saw the pics, the husband would have never told her about the affair. This story is sad. He cheated and the other woman is a mistress."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah was hurt and is still hurt about his husband having another woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Akie Lynn am on my tears😭😭 Keeping going and God will lift you more,Abraham being the head of these  two geogeous ladies, maintain their beauty and make them happy always,despite so many challenges ask God for guidance,and you will conguer,,, big love 💕 to you guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapana. This is a man's world. This is a man's decision. Sera is just playing along. The only beautiful soul here is Sera. The others are pretenders and selfish. He was only concerned how Sera treated Maureen not how Maureen treated Sara. Am not boarding but just live your life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think this was one of the real or rather natural interview that this couple has done,they showed there real them,mistake is done or the choice are made ,its easy to let people be and live their life,the true judge is God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Guys don't you think Abraham himself is a Gold digger? Or let's say an opportunits. From the story we can tell Maureen pockets wasn't bad and it favoured Abraham's company. 
He was ready to break up with Cerah when he was confronted by her but was not ready to tell Maureen the truth about him being a married man in order to save the relationship. 
Poor Cerah had no choice than to fight for what she had built and worked hard for."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lets be real, no woman would be comfortable having a co wife and to make it worse they are best of friends, who is fooling who??????  The guy made it clear he informed Serah Maureen is going no where, if Serah was empowered she would not take this kind of BS. On the other hand, Maureen seems so happy,  I mean the body language says it all since her mission was accomplished  and now she is advising our girls not to be afraid to be second wives, really???????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What sort of nonsense is this 😏😡 you can take it on camera deep down you are sad and broken...and you mr.dont advice us,there is nothing to learn from you,a disgusting example.🙄🙄🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen and Amen 😂 This is Godly
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife always feels the pain I'm a victim and I can tell you it's painful I had to  walk out because I was dying inside and pretending to be happy nothing tusidanganye.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just wanna say that this man would not be sitting there smiling and acting like he is okay if the situation was the other way around. Women, lets value ourselves."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is better than hidden infidelity. Men are just polygamous most important thing is respect and knowing each other's boundaries
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a lady this Cera. My God continue to bless you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's crazy how sinners justify their evil. Which love are we talking about here? Someone need to wake up and just realize their worth.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a shameful man!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Body language I don’t think Maureen is genuine. | can see an unhappy ending for Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"U can stay with your blood sister and feel pieced off,wat abt a co-wife?? Sarah had no otherwise 😭😭😭😭marriage wewe"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati blessings!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have heard several people having the same setup and they are ok provided you don't cross the boundaries, the muigai wa njoroge family, the demathew, Sabina and Esther pasaris are married as a second wives"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When the daughter grows and realizes daddy had to remove her birthday post because of ""love"" to another woman 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So heartbreaking
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So shameful yaani. It's like he was embarrassed of this whole past that he had with this other woman. Even worse, this is on the internet already"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So one day she will definitely see it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Internet never forgets... it even hurt serah more
q4sWUJxjc4g,"...too bad aki,and immature of him.,why not just explain to his new love than hide a kid from a grown up woman!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"May God bless your family Abraham,youare a real Dad❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think serah made a wise decision to accept and to let go of the anger. After all, how many women out there refuse to let go and the wounds they have is still worsening.
The truth is , you can't change what your husband wants to or his decision sometimes. They are polygamous in nature na wengi Wana mipango ya kando huko nje na wengine hide them alot.
It was safe for serah to accept the other chick ndio wako wawili instead of losing a young family they had built together. Shida wa wanawake wengi wakishajua Kuna co- wife wanacreate drama na kuachana na their husbands ONLY kweda kuwa mpango wa kando elsewhere...what's the need of that and maybe the husband doesn't want to lose you still"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is more beautiful, more sophisticated, more collected than Maureen..  whatever this man saw  in this second woman sijui ni nini.
Maureen actually seems and looks so much older than Serah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you are a home wreacker take it to the bank.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne thanks for this interview. Plz do it again  after 3 yrs. Am imagining what happens if paradventure the mother's in law visit at the same time.Am wondering if there would be laughter between the two mother's and esp mama Sara.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really really feel for Sarah. She was played soo badly and made a fool of. She really looks hurt.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Poor serah...may you find love
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh Serah,I feel your pain,my skin crawls on your behalf.I pray that one day you find strength to realise that unacheswo.For now though!! to each their own."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Betrayal at its best,serah is hurting,she is afraid of leaving the union, it's evident enough she lacks a strong support system that would hold her hand..I hope she is making an exit plan .. it is very sad for serah.  I just hope that Abraham will get a third and fourth wife ,that way Maureen will feel the pain she is implicating on serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera... God please hear her silent prayers.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The circumstances surrounding how Serah married this dude was a dishonor to her and I think it played a role in how much he respects her and how things panned out later. Notice that he was impressed by how she did housechores on their day one together, he married her for his convenience. It  was never about love.  Contrast it with how he intentionally pursued Maureen until he got her.
What this guy did is shameful and sinful and a great violation to Serah. What Maureen did is top of the shelf low class. What Serah needs to do is heal the parts of her that think this is acceptable.
Sin is sin. This is an immoral 'union' that is teaching the children wrong things. 
Serah needs to leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also noticed that as well .... Kwanza when he Also said ""she was in heels"" and instantly felt attracted to her is a red flag... HEEEELS really??!!!!!!!! I mean come on 🙄🤦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@itsNyambura-maina  Lyn is also light and in heels, wueeh nikama"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Exactly, she's subconsciously and unintentionally teaching her kids to tolerate nonsense in the name of love. Aki self love is the greatest gift a human can give to themselve."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham hehe.. Is he now done marrying ama 😃
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man has alot of male chauvinist,, infact he didn't care about ceras emotions,,he feared to loose moreen,,cera has been forced to live thr the hard way,,cera alifika to a point akampuuza Abra cox alikuwa amesinywa vya kutosha.. this is glorifying immorality.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looking at the body language of Cera it tells it all that,,she is very unhappy woman.. Cera had been betrayed,, and slained,in her soul,, moreen,may never find peace at some point in future.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My question is why do women give so much authority to men??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is very handsome and a gentleman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah feels betrayed even the way she speaks, she accepted only to keep her marriage. The man was a player so sad🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you for speaking this as a man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera can pretend she is happy with the arrangement, but her eyes and her body language says she is not. Clearly he is arrogant and selfish  and thinks only of what is good for him."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen also does not care about Sera, and she would love it if Sera leaves, but Sera is living a stable life and the pros for stability outweighs the cons."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Media people pls don't give the man your precious air time. Bure kabisa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham described his 1st wife as a full package and am here wondering if so why did he have to go look for a second wife,,only God knows what he wants"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It was Lynn for me,the whole time,the questions!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen ...were you married because of kid???...I wonder how your parents accept this because I will really advise my daughter on this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At least angepea first wife that position, some recognition aki - badala ya kusema they are both mine 😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,ATI whatever am about to tell u may be the last conversation .end of our family...how abt love ..stop this support ..baby thing .....she shed tears .waaah he was so ready to lose serah.. Maureen is so selfish...asking how is serah .the baby ...ain't a thing ..it's not easy even now ..so serah get a life
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy honestly loves Maurine and is with Serah out of respect or maybe image...all through his eyes are stuck on Maureen kwanza kwa the parting shot he said he'll address them as one and was looking at Maureen all the through🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀even a blind man can see this.....to Abraham you have daughters let's see how well you support polygamy when it's your daughter's heart on the line 🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀Serah if you are honestly happy then congrats without judgment but if you are not may God avenge your pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the name Abraham,hoenation direct....all this guys aint comfortable,there really trying but nah imekata..am praying for Serah i really feel her.wueh hii Nairobi aki mimi niliombwa adi doo ya kupea side chick atoe mimba,saizi niko 8 month's pregnant,sidechick naye ni wale madem wapendi mimba adi she had the audacity of finding my number and asking me to help her ask abortion money......hii story ni refu but tunaachia mungu......Serah is really hurting....wangekua wameishi for like 10 years atleast but now hapa tu 2019 then there here narating no way hii yote ni pretending aki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ai no for me aki its always painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,My question is why at first place date a married man. I don't think its a viscous thing to do.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is still not happy with ths
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can read guilt all over Maureen's face. They should wait for the third one coz one character of Abraham is to fall for good calm ladies and we are all over....poor SERA! She is not okay!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Plot twist, Cera and Maureen chases this man and they change everything to their names, kinajiskia sana🤦 men act as if they have a lot of power over women and we don't waste a time to show them that they actually do, the sacrifice both women have gone through 💔 ati nkae niangalie bwana yangu akiingia kwa nyumba ingine, let's not lie, it hurts more than being single"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn a professional journalist I really like your interviewing skills,,  watching from Mozambique"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't even finish listening to this nkt.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so wrong on so many levels……
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This just makes m sick,not good at all,Serah  doesn't  deserve this,she doesn't look happy at all,she's just trying to be cool."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah had no choice,for sure"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! I like this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As long as  I know Maureen is a husband snatcher,and Cera's face vcan tell you coz she no otherwise, period!! yess a destroyer is Maureen,weupe tu not beautiful at all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Infact she looks older than sera by far,,she is brown but ugly structures,,beauty is not defined by color but structures,,,sera is a cute lady,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some women will rather die of kinyongo than share a man. Maybe if serah resisted the hubby angeenda and she would be crying now. 
Smart move Serah. You're very mature. Beautiful, intelligent and very secure.
I watched the Kikuyu version where she said how her cowife helped her postpartum with her 2nd born. I can only Stan ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shes branding herself as a second wife while she's just sugarcoating that in real sense she's a home wrecker up there justifying her infidelity
q4sWUJxjc4g,"WUEH😄Abraham is a real gentleman and Cera has a heart of gold,may that love last forever."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I missed the part where the man apologized to the two for not being honest. The moment the man noticed he was developing feelings for Maureen most likely because they have a lot in common, he should have shared with Serah first to seek permission to move on with possibility of second wife. However, I will give Mwangi the benefit of doubt since he acknowledged that this was a blessing in disguise. 
I am glad this is working for them. It ain’t easy at all, the older we get and more responsibility we get, it is easy to feel alone even when in a crowd. I hope the man continues to love them well as well as love himself. All the best. By the way he comes across as a  learned person and intelligent. It is hard to find that nowadays, especially one who can commit to one woman, this doesn’t make it easy on women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are both leaving a life of denial.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What will happen when its time to go to secondary school and the family can only afford for 2 children to go to private schools. Will peace still reign?
q4sWUJxjc4g,They don’t expect that because he is loaded 😀
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wouldn’t wish to be any of this women, they are paying a very high price both emotionally and mentally"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you are such a hypocrite and you know that deep down.Malipo yako yanakuja and it will slaaaaap so haaaard
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sad indeed. Hugs to Cerah. You need a help seriously. You are a woman of substance, beautiful and hardworking."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a common mang'aa with a nice coat. Maureen is another mang'aa going with someone's husband and pretending it was all roho safi. Cera, caught in between two mang'aas here"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ibrahim didnot expect Sera not to react because of Moreen
q4sWUJxjc4g,90% of the men in the streets are womanizers so I think I would accommodate a second wife in the case of serah instead of lies and prostituting outside there😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ithink it's good to be  true I love that family. si kawaida it's take God grace. Cerah has abig heart💕 love u guys.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He married his first wife when he had nothing and then he decides she's not of his class and gets a professional woman whom he's proud of, I just feel Serah the pain in her heart is obvious even if she says she's fine she's not"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah had a choice bt she came to conclude she has no option.  Who said u hve to stay where u r a second option.  I wish cerah u stood u a ground.  Whether he married again u could hve fought for u a place bt u choose to go his way.  That way he took advantage of your gd heart.  Sorry for judging u bt i leave everything in Gods hand.  Maureen it doesn't matter how u sugarcoat this thing bt in God's en man's eyes u did something wrong.  No woman is comfortable in sharing her man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii story is amazing amazing amazing  nacheka tu peke yangu Waaah May the love of God be with this family ❤❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,You deserve better Cerah...this maureen...your mask slipped when you said you had the wife's number so you could call her if abraham did you wrong...you were never planning to go anywhere typical sidechic
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs Sera, you really are a strong woman, God bless you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kilamwanamke anafa nyumba yake sio kushear kilakitu in the name of kuelewana ju Kuna Moja ana wivu but ana pretend ndio maana inaitwa co-wife Luo called it Nyiego yaani jealousy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am I the only one who understands ALL of them? Like I feel all of them... Am I weird?
q4sWUJxjc4g,No you are not.I also do feel for all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I understand them too perfectly people are being too jugemental
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera you are beautiful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine moreen knew Sera phone number  when she didn't know hers
q4sWUJxjc4g,why is sara not speaking
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah was forced into this situation. Men babies can't handle marriage, they need women to mum them, now this one has two moms, one for chores, the other one to rock him like a baby. Men babies, your days are numbered, women you can't share a man. Those coffee dates Serah talks about are just a painful memory. How do you betray such a loyal woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woi i just feel Serah's pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is not being realistic . She is just burying  her head in the sand
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't get why people think Sera has issues. If she came to the point of accepting she was ok with it otherwise she is an intelligent adult and would have made a choice not to go through a polygamous marriage. She has accepted it .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ibrahim is a crook who needs salvation
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is a nice lady.its only that nowadays polygamy is taken as sin and the Holy Bible refers to such people as death.We all sin differently anyway.All the best for them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you are a great moderator
q4sWUJxjc4g,"9 months of pregnancy plus a child already born yet the wife doesn't know?! This is infidelity, deceit, brainwashing and everything in between. I wouldn't be either of this women and this story shouldn't be normalized. As a married mom of a daughter, I hope to empower mine that such is not okay."
q4sWUJxjc4g,People like to judge what they don't understand
q4sWUJxjc4g,who am i to judge kudos to you guys .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Intriguing story for sure. The part that is saddening is that he might not stop with just those two.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I dont think this would have ever been known, i think maureen was comfortable being a single mom. And if sarah had not found about the child on the phone, i thinl it would still be a secret"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is just nice. Better than sleeping around with several women. I would gladly welcome the second one🥰🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,You must be joking
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Igwa ngoma..in Maina's voice... with all the due respect ...this is disrespectful, malicious and manipulative... I cannot"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me beign the first wife I swear namuacha kwny I can't bare thse bullshit🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I would never set my bar to that level....I opt out.
Let me be thinned by mine but Abraham should have spent more time with Sarah .
The story is  trending coz it's wierd period!!
First wife is strong,wise focused and beautiful .She even moved back to Nairobi for the sake of her family .
As for Maureen I choose 🤐"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If that man was broke, this wouldn't happen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He is a just a cheater, an adulterer and that Maureen is just a homewrecker...Sera u can walk out ,u deserve better...this is just emotional torture."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This story has power and control issues from the man and  he is selfish. The women moved in together strategically to hold him accountable. No more lies of Iam with Moureen etc. living in the same house is not going to work, you can see life pressure is almost breaking them into pieces. Cera said sometimes she has to remind Abraham to give her attention. looking up to the heavens and saying a prayer for you Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah, this man Abraham never loved you... It's like aliona umejipeleka kwake and you started doing the wife duties yet he had not settled on you...... He never loved you and I doubt if he'll ever do..... I'm sorry for what you've been through, may Jesus give you peace and courage to get out of this mess..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,B.S
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh God no, this NO."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jealous woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@dukeofrideshare I don't care what you say but NO
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think Abraham asking people not to got at Maureen had a negative effect. He should just have let the story take a life of its own. One thing people are overlooking is that both women are capable of being successful on their own. People seem to think interior design is an inferior line of work, on the contrary. I also don't think Wecerah is hanging on to the relationship, I think Abraham does love her. I have seen comments saying about the way Abraham was looking at Maureen, how about how he kept touching Wacerah, physical touch is a love language and there was quite abit of it between the 2. Maureen and Abraham are in IT and thats how they met so I can understand that they are now working together, why  would Wacerah tag along just so they are all spending time together. Cerah has a small baby and her line of work is physically demanding and she needs  to recover before she can go back to her work. 
I personally cannot be able to be handle such a relationship but to each his own. Perhaps all the commentors who are here can help Cerah thrive by giving her work when she resumes working  and make her busines thrive. I don't understand plural marriages but if Cerah is truly distressed in the situation, she due to  her social media presence  has people she can reachout to leave the situation. However it should be her decision and not being coersed by the court of public opinion. PS: Not everyone looks at things in biblical/or other belief terms and religion and politics are a personal decision, please know that your personal believes may not apply to others."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is the third Wheel here, I Hope she finds her happy place someday. Father Abraham and Mami Maureen are very happy by the Look, Serah get healing. Truly adulthood is a scam."
q4sWUJxjc4g,How does it feel when someone says they spotted you for business and not your looks or character! How narcissistic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Expected to hear about the taking of turns in the bedrooms
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣..I was waiting kuskia story za 3-some.  But was disappointed they never mentioned anything about it. 🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just straight up wrong ,I can see the pain in Sera's eyes...this man is just disgusting..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Think this guy is just selfish and a user and he found himself two hard working ladies with low self esteem..I wonder if they both didn't have successful businesses if he would even look at them. From cutting mboga to owning two businesses owners!!! See how he keeps saying the relationships both started from  business! Jamani
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you’re delusional and a home wrecker
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My question is how can one shared a husband with another woman ????? 

Someone put some sense to me please."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"IF GOD CAME TODAY KENYAN WOMEN WILL GO TO HEAVEN ""HOLY THAN THE SPIRITUAL BEINGS"" THE MOST PRETENDING CREATURE'S IN THE WORLD. WATU WACHE KUJIFANYA MARAIKA."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You'll be surprised most who are yapping here have slept with countless men ..have done weird things in life including abortions..but here swearing thell  never share a man..nkt!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have no words, like many have said  in this channel , hope all the girl children  in my family will have enough economic resources to never be caught up in this mess. my personal opinion."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah..walk out hunie.achana na hizo mbuzi mbili.Betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissists do not love you. They love what you do for them. Why was Maureen loved?. These two ladies are just suppliers of babas needs.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well..i was going to give my opinion about how we all ought to live and let live, but after watching and reading the comments, it is my humble view that this throuple should have kept their arrangement private and not put it out there for us to judge. The overwhelming negative reactions, I am willing to bet, may eventually put a strain on their relationship(s). Maybe it would have been better to just live their lives in private...🤔. I, however, realise that it is their life to do with as they wish, as is the case with all of us."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have watched this couple kwa gumzo sauti and they were superficial but Lynn has done her thing again. POLYGAMY is not terrible when done in the right traditional rules and regulation of the society where by the 1st wife has a say on the matter lakini hii nayo tumechezwaa...
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope Abraham will not go for the third wife.He is quite young for polygamy. I feel sorry for that beautiful woman Serah.Maurine should not have agreed to get married to Abraham knowing that he had a wife.Who wants to share a husband in this century.I don't think Serah is happy deep deep down her heart.l wish her all the best.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think sometimes women stay coz they are in a fixed situation and being a single parent is not easy. I feel for the 1st wife and I hope that one day she can be truly honest with herself despite the position she would be in incase she left. Again if she is happy I wish her all the best. If not well I hope she will have the courage and strength to go.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn. This a classic narcissism world.the current status has a definition called triangulation. Meanwhile Sarah has been take through full cycle of love bomb, devalue and discard. The two are been played. Only chosen ones can clearly see and understand what is going on here."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My grandpa  was polygamous  my friend b4 he died the family  fights both wives n children....  waaah hii ni kali but truth is  they will  come  to understand  as kids grows...
All the best  👍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah please just go back home to your dad, and God will see you through"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow... this is so off. May Serah find the healing she really needs.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""eyes are windows to the soul"".....and Abraham..Serah tells us that this is just a visually striking performance. Enjoy before the last episode."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Much as I want to write something positive about this....my heart is broken for Sera.....her husband brought his infidelity  home .....as for Maureen, you're a beautiful girl,  I wonder why you chose to be the second best....you had a chance to walk away when you find out he was married"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa ata muna ambie aje Sarah will always feel betrayed  she just put a plastic smile.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Watching this in too many phases. Can not digest alot of this conversation
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is the best than the men out there parading women left right center am proud of sarah juu she had a choice to say no but could not have stopped him to go out there hiding
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great Family So Lovely 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰Congratulations 🎊 👏🏿 💐 MR. ABRAHAM...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, you are a good interviewer!!!  You have brought out the truth in this matter.  Thank you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy thinks this will work?? Living with 2 women in the same house won't end well. Obviously the first wife is pretending. Ile siku atasota ataona moshi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Was I not enough for him🤔🤔?""that's a question Serah will never stop asking her self.
This is heartbreaking for me💔. I can't imagine my spouse bringing in a second wife. The thought of him sharing intimate moment with another woman next door wrecks my heart💔.Serah understood how much he loved Maureen and she didn't want to loose him.He saw a wife material in Serah but a soulmate in Maureen. He was ready to loose Serah however she chooses to stay clearly she didn't have a choice.
For this to work one of them has to stomach a lot.
All the best y'all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯 percent correct.Yaani sera anaumia sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometimes women do make some tough decisions just to secure the place for their kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True, if this man feared God, he wouldn't have done this. Cera is hurting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah should know that she's not enough for Abraham...he found better in Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ur comment is making a lot of sense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham says that love is unlimited. My foot! What is unlimited is lust. Others go for mpango wa kando to quench their lust. Good luck with the 3rd and 4th wives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing to be proud of. Sarah is a great lady who does not deserve betrayal. She sounds hurt. To be honest, what Maureen did was wrong. Moving into Sarah's house is a No, No for me."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As much as Maureen tries so hard to explain she didn’t know he was married and how she tried to end the relationship after she found out ,she Is a home wrecker and nothing will ever change that,serah’s heart is pure and she is a very calm lady but it’s obvious this whole arrangement does not sit well with her,like how does she feel when her husband  goes to sleep in the same room with Maureen?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wish you well and enjoy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen shouldn't face hatred or accusations of destroying Abraham &Sarah's marriage..Its a common thing in Africa for  men to have more than 1 wife n extended family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love how you ask questions lyn..iyo nayo ni talent
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That was as clear as day how this went down. This man said ""l will protect Maureen"",  ""She is going no where"" etc.... and he had no specific commendation for Serah. Who will protect Serah?  My heart breaks for Serah. Serah, you are in a very difficult situation. Leave it to God! I pray for you Psalms 23:5  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head ... oil; my cup overflows. You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies …. Serah you are a brilliant woman. You are not alone. As mothers we persevere a lot for the sake of our children. May God cover you with His protection.📿"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Honestly i feel so much pity for Serah. I wish she can walk out and find peace. Im also very mad at maureen and this man. Whatever they think they doing is very bad. I wish God can give Serah someone better
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah deserves so much more. She looks too beautiful and amazing to share a husband. Wishing her the very best, she deserves true happiness and peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even if she was ugly sharing is painful.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one deserves to share a husband!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@loidatebo2076 🤣🤣🤣see this one ...

q4sWUJxjc4g,Pretenders!...who can't see Sarah is not okey...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is just the way she looks, don't say oo she looks sad and everything come on you noher more than the people who leave with her??? She agreed to stay with her second wife to her husband no one force her to it's her and there choice, atlist thy agree to put there dfrent aside and give peace to this relationship come on."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not okay...Maureen is shameless atleast she could have stayed far from the home
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He can Spend lone time with Maureen in the name of work but but not with Serah! That they must go dinner dates together! Ones Zuri is grown enough for her to go back to work watamuonea kwa TV ya masagari, that woman is not a fool ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The naked truth is Abraham cheated on and betrayed Cera!! Periodt.
Anyway, nothing goes wrong, it only starts wrong."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It was hard watching this. That Abraham guy? Hell NO
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah was to accept due to how the husband  responded,he didn't want to loose serah at the same time he could didn't agree to loose moreen,serah loved the man very much and she new if she could not accept moreen she could end up losing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is very beautiful family. I wouldn't mind a cowife🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,May your prayer be answered as soon as possible
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have a sneaky feeling Serah will leave this union one day.
Betrayal is hard to hide for long.
More Grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've watched all their interviews and one thing that is very constant is that  Sera is still in pain. Body language never lies!!!!! May God do her good.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let her reach 40. Age 40 hits differently. Sera that they know will change into something else 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@carolBee2023 she wont leave, sera ni wale housewives who stay with her husbands no matter how much they cheat. shida ya such, they suffer n husbands continue disrespecting them coz they know they arent going anywhere"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@joycykirui9999 even if she doesn't leave, it won't be business as usual. Something happens to a woman when she reaches that age. Self awareness or something."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The only honest person here is Sera, no wonder Abraham keeps intercepting her talks because-he knows she will tell it at it is. I wish Lynn had asked Maurine if she would have acted the same way had she been in sera’s shoes."
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no honor in this act. Truth be told.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No man can force me into something I don't want to especially when I know it's wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is just like Abraham from the bible with Haggai and Sarah 😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki this man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is really hurting, no matter how she pretends that everything is okay. Her eyes speaks so much.. What the audience is seeing is actually different from what she's speaking. May the Lord God grant her grace, it is hard, very. Eventually I feel like she'll walk out one day... Let's give it time but wueeh, I wish them all the best, but all I know second wives are family destroyers I'll never agree even though she says she has no ill intentions, the society will always view her different.

Besides God created Adam and Eve, that's where marriage is emulated, look at the case of Abraham and Sara... Yaani mtu aniongeleshe aniambie nielewe..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is a very wise woman, she did not want to destroy her home with her own hands. Adam loves Serah a lot there is no doubt about that and i respect the fact that when all this happened he took responsibility like a man which most men in that situation don't. Kudos Abraham and Serah for holding tightly and focusing on the bigger picture, the Children. Maureen thanks for the respect you have shown so far. I wish this family the best. I will not judge anyone as no one is perfect. Love is beautiful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thus maureen anakaa sumu
q4sWUJxjc4g,These 3 beautiful adults have made a decision. I wish you peace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True it's their life and choice
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@yolisamrso9827 True.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My prayer to Serah is that she gets the courage to leave....and that God will open her heavens so she won't care about what she will miss in this confusion in the name of a relationship...she is so beautiful and she deserves better. She can't miss a man in these streets! Meanwhile I hope karma will do its work.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope suitors are watching her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh God. Painful truth. Let's empower our girls with skills and education.This is soo sad...aki Sara,may God bless you and open your eyes."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"We are all you unique and views things differently and thus okay, hugs Abraham empire and don't allow any amount of hatred to disunite you guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My dear Abraham...live like your sake name...he tried what exactly doing but what happened? ..not hate speech though,David when he took or admired another wife how did it end, they were great men as you said  but how did they finish...will you want such ...Gus as you walk on think about the end not the starting .people not good but always corrections not bad even be4 God is hallowed. .."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They all look happy though
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤔🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"These 3 people made a choice to be one family despite being aware of the risks ahead. My take, whatever comes in life your choices mater so choose wisely and block the haters."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Life is unpredictable
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man never loved serah from begining, it was lust...... From where he said .......the skin color is his weakness..... Serah is hurting.... He'll definitely bring 3rd , 4th......10th..
Serah, hope all will be well"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Linda Muthama tried it with Mong'are & his wife (though they weren't all living together but claimed to all hv a cordial relationship with each other), but after 10yrs ikamshinda."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy like our forefathers is better than mzungu lodgings.  
They have choosen love over hate.  Stay strong guys"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wazungu ni homosexuality wanajua tu.  Polygamy Is great  !
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@dukeofrideshare lodgings never existed before the mzungus because women had homes even one man could keep ten women if He could. The insecure controlling women want to own a man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,If you can't beat them join them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn you nailed this interview yaani nikama ulirehearse mbaya sana 😆
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Afadhali huyu jamaa had the guts to be himself and handle the situation,what about those who pretend and take cover in religion. And never zip up☹️🙄😳,even though it may never be right and inside is hidden,the courage is the strength. 
This life is a test and the way you respond to each test,makes the whole difference.May the Almighty guide and make our end deeds the best."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah looks very humble and kind.. I feel sorry for her even though she insist that she's fine. She's didn't have a choice but let this other person comes into their life.. If you noticed she's the only one who said to Abraham that she loved him.. I am not here to judge but iwas confronted to such 7years ago and my humble answer was no thanks..I will repeat the same in a hundred years time. Reke nemwo priss
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah kuna space ya number 3 🤦🤦🤦🤦
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is kinda rude, i feel serah , hugs dear🤗"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hehe mukona Tari wega mwikite. 😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waah🤔🤔I have put this comment and hope we will revisit this interview after 7 years
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn Ngugi, thumbs up Girl 😘😘 you're very couragious. God bless you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah your heart  melts everything   especially  your last words  towards Abraham ..Mapenzi wewe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham's decisions were just to look out for Maureen, there is definitely a lot they can't let us know...I feel like Maureen is manipulative chini ya maji"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah's self-esteem needs to be revived Aki girl is in an emotional fix or something.. She looks and sounds reduced smh.. God talk to serah you created her
q4sWUJxjc4g,😅😅😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ain't 2nd wives supposed to be young and beautiful?what is this?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A situation of keep your enemies closer.....this is so selfish of him, how could you do this to your wife just coz you can afford it!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ate you happy..... Her reply was am comfortable....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No woman allows  polygamy,but at times ,you just accept because it has happened, I grew in a polygamy family,I did not finish my education because of polygamy, I won't support  it,but incase iwe,I will be very humble to the first wife,because I know she can curse me if I won't respect her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can he balance himself between 2 women ??if both of them leave him..who is on the loosing side???
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't look happy at all but she must fake it my opinion though
q4sWUJxjc4g,Betray is the word here...weee Abraham no brinking
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad sad sad nothing to smile about. Ati he wears ironed socks weeeuh!! I pray no other woman gets to go through this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A second wife is home breaker period, and by the way why do they live in the same House?? Si Kila mtu aishi kivyake 🙄🙄🙄🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,That guy is selfish mtceeww
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My two cents: Maureen, no amount of sugar coating can explain this. You filled a ‘gap’ in his life - the business crossed lines while you watched. For Serah, I pray you find boldness to heal and make the right decision. Heal and love yourself.

Abraham. This is just a proud man who thinks TOOO HIGHLY of himself. May you find light one day. And, you can take this to the bank : a third and forth and fifth are on the way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,... not forgeting mipango ya kando!!! He found an answer to his chores
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love your reasoning,🥰🥰🥰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Living in defiled marriage. You Abraham need to meet Jesus  Christ.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham please  sleep in the same bed with both ladies,,I mean that wd show equality for ur love.
Women u shd understand whether by church or traditional marriage NO ONE  WOMAN is ever enough for a man,Black,White,Asians it's in their DNA.
Abraham u cheated on Serah but thank God  these two ladies came to understand and not fight each other, Maureen whatever happens never ever toture Serah,she is a very wise and strong woman.
I won't judge they are all adults with choices."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I read the comments before watching this and I could guess who Serah is before they introduced themselves. The body language and facial expressions was everything! just sad 💔.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn i like your questions to Abraham about the coffee dates with Maureen.🤣 He feels pushed though!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sioni vile I can Love my hubby and be okay sleeping in one room knowing well what the Man i started life with is doing in the other room with another woman. No way!!!!! Aki ata kama unafanya kuprovide from Moon and Back
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is so annoying!!! I hate how they're laughing at the lies he was telling Cerah, she must have been in a lot of pain."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Body language itself tells Abraham loves maureen than he does serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Our Grandpa's put their wives in the same compound different houses, Our Fathers put their wives in different Cities, Our Generation have taken it a notch higher, they're now under one roof..... guess the seed you're planting in your kids, they'll have their two women not only under one roof, but in the same bed and room coz they're watching you campaign about the beauty of what you guys have."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is handsome. ☺
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is the one God acknowledge, Maureen you are very young to be a second wife...one day you will know it was a mistake to break someone home...malipo ni hapa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And two will join and become one hii formula ya three sielewi, it's all vanity ask Solomon he will tell you.
There can never be happiness living in sin."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah deserves better!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The truth is that wanajifanya,kaa kukaa na bestie yako kwa nyumba moja mnakosana  je kushare  doshi na side chic?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My God help me not to be the cause of pain to any woman on this earth. When he approaches me holyspirit give me a sign that he is married, I don't want any blame in this world. May the Almighty God heal you Serah and give you direction."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is full of himself. No love for serah at all. May Serah find peace one day. Maureen and Abraham have manipulated Serah, the game they are playing on her is on another level."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Infidelity and blackmail!  Serah is playing defeatist. Too bad for women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I only see a self centered husband to has enough money to get what he wants.
My husband better not take notes from this one cause I won't sit pretty and let him bring his clande home 
What you don't know doesn't hurt."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Y'all goatwives be here yapping Maureen is a home wrecker while in real sense your husbands be chasing different girls every wikend... this is the best way to go and I support this with my entire clan, thumbs up Mr Abraham ur a true definition of a real man 💃💃💃💃"
q4sWUJxjc4g,betrayer!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just hope Serah is happy as she says.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful Sarah with a golden heart you are pillar of that family defentry
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wear ironed socks,nkt.At the expense of someones hapiness.Maureen and Abraham muoane na muache Sera na amani."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks lonely 😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We are all here crying over a relationship that is working in their own way. I commend the guy for being open. Afadhali yeye kuliko those that do mpango wa Kando permanently.
Let the family lead their life. After all polygamy is legal in Kenya! 😆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just when you think you’ve seen it all🥹
q4sWUJxjc4g,So Maureen gets to have a child with a man she came to found out was married?????? This is a man's game over a woman.  Look at how he justifies his behaviour!!!!!!!!! like he did not have a choice!!!!!!! men think women are really stupid!!!!!!!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sereh is very clever, why kill somebody and rot in jail."
q4sWUJxjc4g,We need to be honest. SERAH had no choice but Maureen is a golddigger.Maureen wanted to destroy Serah's marrige but Serah stood strong. I salute serah xx
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the time of the Bible and even the times of our fore father's, every woman with their tent, hut,house yawa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's nothing good about this setup honestly.The first wife is just there because she didn't want to loose what is has invested for years, but she is not happy, she is just pretending."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not happy at all you can see her facial expressions
q4sWUJxjc4g,After all this won't convince me to accept a second wife or being one never
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is obviously not happy..how can a woman jus get so comfortable messing another woman's marriage..wat if places were traded..Maureen is not the kind to jus let things slide,she's bad. And this father Abraham lazma anajiskia mwanaume sana having two women under him.arrgg!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The third wife is saumasaulting.Maureen prepare another bed and lots of love and tolerance to give.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thumbs up to you Lynn, you handled very sensitive questions with such Grace, you managed to expose the facade that is behind this marriage. A man who is used to getting his way and doesn't understand the process or institution of marriage nor respect it. From wife number one coming one day and staying forever and when asked if he had legally married her he fumbled on his words. A man being applauded for being a cheat and a liar. We are living in perilous times indeed."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well said, but let’s not just blame the man only. These two women have enabled him, and allowed themselves to be disrespected, starting with the way they “got married.”"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Soo true
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@blessedwachera7133 I completely concur with you. boundaries must be had in relationships. We get what we allow.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like watching your stories Lynn but I barely comment but this one nooo......the man is just justifying his ego. Your first question to him says it all. ""Abraham, do you think someone can love two peoples? The n he goes ahead and says that is more than love.......... when we humans  can't love perfectly. My brother there's nothing beyond love. You are simply justifying your wrong doing. Among the two women one is hurt,only that she numb"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy thinks that his good looks and his way with words can make him superior to women.All those are Gods gifts but he is mis using them.He also pretends to be so into children just as a trap.Serah marry another man,be pregnant and let him come to your house tuone how he will react."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,1 thing to note... Serah is still there because Abraham won't let his children live away from him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one can serve two masters in this world 🌍 hapo Kuna mtu anaumia🤭
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just feel sad for Serah. It's evident in her eyes that she really feels hurt by the way she was betrayed by Abraham. This Abraham doesn't love anybody but himself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The level of disrespect, insults and manipulation this Cera/sera lady has gone through from these two selfish beings is immeasurable. Divine grace upon this woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaaa this one to me haingework kabisa I moureen with my temper
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A society that celebrates infidelity in the name of polygamy is very unfortunate. That you find it okay to make selfish stunts, that I have made a choice and it's a take it or leave it affair, just sad. That you think secrecy is the big sin and not infidelity?We are not repentant that we have fallen short we just regret being caught. I am broken. And in all this Serah is simply a passive participant who is left at the mercy of just accepting the situation which she was not a part from the onset.The marriage institution is not a playfield for siring children but an institution of intimate companionship and oneness whose players forsake all others irregardless of the ability or feelings to do otherwise inorder honor a covenant , if the reverse had happened and Serah had two husbands would we still applause the act?Lord help us."
q4sWUJxjc4g,this man is a dissapointment
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are okay I don't know why  people are criticizing,,,they are one happy family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kuna mtu anafikiria Chenye nafikiria ??…Ama niache kiherehere😅Watu wanafikiria narcisism and stuff mi nafkiria zangu😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The questions weee. Lynn good work. Ceera doesn't seem happy at all, but it seems she has no otherwise"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Shame on the second wife and the boy, she on you million times.

Even more painful to here how he met and what attracted him to his  second wife, that is painful for me and I can only imagine the 1st wife. Oh well if that's what make Sarah or Cela happy, theb be it but shame and hurtful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1. This story is cooked up it keep changing from interview to interview..
2. But Lynn wueh ,Maureen is even confused when answering the questions
3. Abraham keeps interrupting sera when she is asked questions
4. The way Abraham describes Maureen,he loves her more fore sure
5. Sera questions have been answered  from this interview, questions she was never allowed to ask probably"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This pure nonsense ...Serah""s calmness will one day blow up on this fake love they got with Maureen ..  Father Abraham is a narcissist"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don’t care how much you try to sugar coat this , the minute you find out this man was married with kids you should have shut off all communication, not go and have a full baby with another woman’s man , 
If i was Cera I would pack my bags and leave ASAP this is unacceptable in Gods eyes also she deserves better 
The only reason this works is because of Cera staying"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera... there's no love here with your man father Abraham, choose your life wisely, you're a beautiful lady you deserve to be loved and also to be valued. This is not a marriage it's won't last long..pole Sera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera must be suffocated by this lady . We can't be two wives in same house. Maureen should have remained I  her own house
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapo kwa how he met maureen Abraham is excited to explain n remembers vividly.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ghai Abraham could have done better ningeelewa.. Serah is cute
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wife material activists be like; 
""When you visit your man, you should do some cleaning so that he can see the womanly qualities in you and your ability to handle house chores as a wife in future.""
Ona Sasa. Cerah washed Abraham's house sparkling clean and what were the results? He married a second wife. Scam! Upuuss!! 🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Tell me about it 🙄🙄🙄. I will not even move the spoon, NEVER!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣 hata mimi nimebaki kinywa wazi.  After all that performance nigga went out and had a full affair and he would have it going had Sarah not found out Maureen had a child with her husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@NellyMacharia Correct
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can relate too I used to date a Nigerian guy and I bought new bedding from dunelms for him which is a very expensive shop , I also bought him a laundry basket from there and gifts. Then he started verbally abusing me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah Hana choice 😭🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera ask yourself one thing.... How long will you continue suffering is such pain and masking it with fake smiles to please the world. You are beautiful you can still get a man who will love you for you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't understand why someone would want to put that type of pain onto someone. Making them sit there and question what they did wrong, if they're good enough....what hurts the most is when the person who cheated starts justifying their actions."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is she allowing herself to be put in that situation? She’s a fully functioning adult woman. She has a choice to walk away from this mess.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see a problem here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,😏see a man with dimples run 🏃🏿‍♀️plaaaayy boy 🧐
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Get back to us in 10 years, we see how this experiment is going."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kusema ukweli Serah nikuchezwa alichezwa. I hope she digests this situation properly ajitoe mapema..Maureen is an upgraded sidechick.The husband is very manipulative...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaah ok ni sawa Sarah she's  soo beautiful  na polite aki.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weuuuh...I wouldn't advocate for this. My mom is from a polygamous family and even if my granddad is wealthy...the hatred between the 2 families has been dragged down to us. And what am sure of is that..it isn't ending anytime soon.

My grandma na pa are over 80s now and sometimes you can see how grandma regrets sticking with pa, supporting him until he became rich only for him to get a second wife.

As for my granddad, he regrets almost 5 times in a day. We might be having a conversation with him then from nowhere he just says why didn't he stick with his first wife.

So for me this is a no no no. Its either me or no me."
q4sWUJxjc4g,A second wife is not a wife but a mpango wa kando  or a painkiller note that my classmate Maureen...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lazy Women, following hyena for a piece of meat,,Man,,,no love there MONEY,,,Get broke today you will know that you don't know,,,,for the women,, wait for number 3and number 4"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This show is 🔥
q4sWUJxjc4g,No waaayyyyy....Sarah God bless you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am just here wondering if in future the daughters were to go through the same would he be ok?? Anyway Sera ako mfunny ata 😂😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Cerah hanipati maskio"" uwee,
You can never type embarrassment without men in it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I couldn't even finish listening to the whole interview but the fact remains Sera is hurt and hiding it with a fake ok and a fake smile...her speech and facial expression could tell it all ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hurt is all round her face...
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a player .I won't be surprised if a third a woman is added to this equation soon.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pesa ikizidi atajengea wa tatu another City
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Their 'friendship' was a coping mechanism. Being nice to each other is about a woman understanding another and realizing the man is the biggest winner in the whole equation.. 
Maureen giving Cerah the job opportunity was a smart move to make her feel she was of value to her..
I imagine one woman going through the night knowing dude is busy in the other bedroom🙌 Really unlikely to bear when a woman loves so I know someone killed their feelings and just adjusted to the new reality. Too many suppressions.. Torturous even!! 
Cerah narrating the confrontation moment, you can still feel her pain. 
It's all messy! So messy😇"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's okay but not me in this!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is always shocked and frozen 😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,They're all well learned & mature...if it works for them who are we to cast stones? if you think this is a sin just know  you're not special cause you sin differently...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mr Man never loved Cera bt he respects her and apreciats her ... But the intrigue Maureen has on him is natural and can't change... He loves Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Seraph is not happy from her face
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am sorry but this is so bad and Sarah is till hurting on this but she is just keeping up on it. He is very selfish and hurting and no matter what, Maureen and him are happy jovial in talking about it but Sarah its not all that but she lives in acceptance but not welcoming.period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray and hope one day Sera gets to heal from the disease that Abraham is. Maureen is lying about not knowing this man was married. She knew!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This lnterview was lit i must say...Abraham's family is composed and mature. Mungu awazidishie maisha marefu
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not according to God's will...May God Open their eyes to see that what they are doing is not right...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Such scenario happened to me on 2018 to make the matter worse the woman was much older than me we were  in process of dowry negotiations  I had to stop everything I choose peace n walked out for good I hated loving till date.the 1st wife doesn't look fine with the whole thing from the look.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you forgot one topic in this interview, the bedroom affairs now that they live in same house , asking for the kamati 🫣. “Why Am l saddened to hear Sarah say that Abraham is the best thing that happened to her ❤️‍🩹”. Nevertheless Lynn excellent interview as always💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She did ask. Only with tact. Indeed Lynn you are awesome.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the typical case of having your cake and eating it. Sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So sorry for Sarah . It's all written on her face the pain she is going through.No woman can be happy sharing her husband with another woman.May God strengthen her and help her.For Abraham,I think he is a selfish man,can he take half of what Sarah has gone through in that arrangement if the same was done to him?To Maureen, please just leave that man for Sarah and also hand over your daughter to her,she has a clean heart she will look after her  and trust God for your own husband.Please, don't hurt Sarah more than that ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man has soft heart for sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for cerah😢😢😢 i hope she is genuinely happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am seeing so many negative comments. People should get off ignorant and leave grown folks to do whatever they please. I believe if there is enough understanding and love, the children are better off than single mothers' children whose mothers are all over the place."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My take, Cera is respected and appreciated bt was never loved in the first place"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For Sarah you have a strong heart to accept Maurene,my brother have 2 wife he got married 1st had 4 boys and my brother needed girl so he decided to marry wife no 2 to bare baby girl but eventually it never happened so far my brother with his 2 wives have total of 7 boys and he is over 60 yrs so I am not expecting any girl soon haha"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The ignorance around who determines the gender of the baby really gets me! 🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man cheated ,mpango wa kando got pregnant and unfortunately dealing with the consequences had to involve Beautiful Cera.it’s not like she was given a choice,period.yap!lets not glorify immortality!!!!more grace to you Cera ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I felt physical pain watching this. 

Some people sacrifice more than they receive in return. 

Case in point Ceera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why would women not want something Amazing like this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man needs to tell us the location of his native doctor.

Or share contacts"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If Kenya was a person,how exactly is this right? This guy has selfish written all over him,eehh my fellow mommas don’t ever allow a man to reduce you to this for his own benefit # totally unacceptable 😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can not be surprised to find that guy with a side dish 🤣🤣Men 🙌🙌🙌love from UGANDA 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬❤️🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can not be surprised to find that guy with a side dish 🤣🤣Men 🙌🙌🙌love from UGANDA 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬❤️🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's something about this man that is just off!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh much respect for you Abraham and your two lovely wives...you are blessed and you will live long bro! Never loose focus because of stone throwers what matters is the happiness of your family period! We live in a world in which people don't know what they want. You do good they criticize, you do bad they criticize  and so you can never please people. Focus  on your happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just a facade. God forbid, if anything happens to this guy you'll see the endless court battles. Deep down there's some pain,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki n the way first wife is soo pretty .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This can't be easy and will never be, I grew up in the same situation, my mom and my dad's second wife in the same house, just because my mom had no choice, growing up, we the kids were very much okay, loved each other like siblings until we all grew up and understood everything, my mom was not okay and there is no way I was going to be okay either, so the fights between me and my step mom begun......ni juzi tu God gave me the grace to forgive her, my mom is the first wife. So after we finished college my mom decided to retire early for the sake of separation, so she is currently in the village and it's much better though still praying for total separation, coz we don't want her following my mom again in the village, but by now, we have no issues with her, I personally forgave her for what she put my mom through but staying together ain't healthy. And my mom is Serah, was considering naming my daughter after her if blessed with one but after listening to this, honestly,no way!!! But I pray this two be at peace for ever"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, please change that name because there is power in a name. And then instill values in your children from a very young age, so they know how they need to be treated."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@blessedwachera7133 sure, I have sons already, and I'm teaching them to respect women and also not to let any one disrespect them, I just want them to have good manners, I believe you can't go wrong with that alongside standing up for themselves"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@eldequinmunyao442 And one day in their future, your sons will be grateful that you instilled those values in them. Men like Abraham do not respect women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@eldequinmunyao442 I understand you, my mum she is the first wife and it is was very painful for me to accept that my dad married a second wife and since that time I stopped talking to my dad till he died last month so painful watching your mother bieng brought a second wife"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife is not beautiful at all actually she looks older than Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah uko very beautiful may the Lord continue giving u peace and wisdom coz the story is painful more love mum God is with u
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't understand the living situation... it's crazy to say the least.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am a product of polygamy and i will never ever recommend to anybody. I suffered most because my mom decided to get married as a third wife. Stay away from polygamy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham what attracted you to wife these ladies ?
Sarah : she cleaned my house and washed my dishes .. so I told her to stay 
Maureen : we worked together she strengthened my business so we had coffee
 dates at 7:30 and I wouldn’t go home , I would ask her sawa where are you going ?
Moral of the story if someone asks how you met and the only thing they say is how you made their life easier …. Ruuuuuuuuuuuun!😅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is selfish. This is all about him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is humble...i just love her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I must say, Lyn is an excellent interviewer.

As for Cera, the pain is still visible, but it will never hurt as much again. Plus, It will heal completely.

As for Maureen, brace yourself, humans are creatures of pattern/habit. And patterns repeat themselves."
q4sWUJxjc4g,One thing Adam sure has is the hoe-dacity! 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why does Abraham keep saying Sasa huyu.. While referring to Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Na kumbe huyu Abraham ni vindu vihot hivi😍😍anioe wamwisho ndio amalize sasa....on a lighter note btw🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God please keep me far away from this kind of man, silent narcissist 🤮🤮🤮 ewww look at him pretending to be composed as he manipulates these two beautiful women"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow serah is a strong woman and understanding and i love the maturity on her how she solved the situation sending love and hugs from my ends may God bless you abundantly❤🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Matters of the heart are complicated, relationship dynamics are not exactly a black & white affair, no 2 are the same, all unique in their own way.... 
And with that said, maybe Serah is genuinely happy and content with her choices.🤷🏽‍♀️We don't know! - The way I see it, she doesn't exactly come off as this mindless idiot who was manipulated into an unwanted threeway😏- When it comes to Maureen & Abraham, who are we to judge?!.. To me, these 3 seem to be truly happy with whatever they have going on among them. To be honest, that's their business.
Let people be! What works or doesn't work for you doesn't necessarily mean it should or shouldn't apply to others. People are just different. Point. Blank. Period!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen “I don’t like like going to bars and clubs “ 
Meanwhile at 21:21 … there’s a picture of Maureen and Abraham in a bar / club 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen has lied severally in this interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen lies...mara I didn't know he was married....then later, I all along had Sarah's number"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"🤣🤣🤣🤣..she trys so much to justify her actions..bt she shld rmber karma is a bitch, she will still come around"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see pretence every time she opens her mouth  alijua ameoa tena hakujua ameo...no peace for the wicked
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you are Wise
q4sWUJxjc4g,Si threesome yao huslap  basi ? 🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was thinking the same...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It was nice watching this interview
I love how you interviewed them
Good job ❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men will always be men..the first feelings serah had after she discovered there's another woman tells it all...all the others are pretence.u dnt expect her achome kwa camera .deep inside she is hurting but doesn't have a choice alee watoto wake
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men will always be men..the first feelings serah had after she discovered there's another woman tells it all...all the others are pretence.u dnt expect her achome kwa camera .deep inside she is hurting but doesn't have a choice alee watoto wake
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah? Seriously? May be. People are different.  I hate it when I meet someone who claims to love me, we struggle together to build a home, then a third party comes in the name of 'second wife' when my back is bended from hardworking? Not me at all.  But Maureen watch out, when a third one comes in, just accept her as well the way Serah welcomed you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is too much ooouh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometimes it’s ok to just let go!... eish! Sera si must... weeeh God help us!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs to sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hope someone can volunteer to take cera through counseling, she is depressed and in pain... letting another woman in her house, make love in the some house, wake up in the some house!!! Lord before such a day come make sure you have given me more money 💰. Am raising a daughter, I wanna tell her what a marriage should like and never to compromise on anything, I wanna raise a strong daughter who loves herself and knows he boundaries, so helpe God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Ibrahim
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is telling serah all the things he doesn’t like about her through maureen wins. This guy liked her coz she could keep his house clean 😭. This guy is a user jeso! He liked maureen juu anamsaidia in his business i cant! U cant have everything! Is it on purpose that maureen is calling serah sarah?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah gave up on this fool kitambo. Sometimes you just stay physically there but mentally..... ulienda.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I respect their decision and I wish them all the best  but as for me and myself I'm not a candidate of sharing my hubby 😘 ❤....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Honestly I don't believe that there is a blessing in a union where there is cheating (unfaithfulness). What does the bible tell us about family???. Why didn't God creat two wives for Adam???. Anyway time will tell.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Welcome to Kenya, where you find your true love when you are married..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Your soul tie.
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true soita
q4sWUJxjc4g,imagine 😏😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣kiangai
q4sWUJxjc4g,Future anguish for the kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think this all about money!
q4sWUJxjc4g,The truth is this was just another cheating man with an ordinary selfish side chick. The reason its a family right now is because of the  wife Serah she's exceptional and graceful and one of a kind. I hope God lights her way all her life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is a scam, Cera is not happy at all,
Now these beautiful ladies will have to compete cooking nicely, hairstyles dressing to please Abraham!!!!! Fungueni Macho jameni"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No comments for this......I wish them well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,A polygamy is a no go zone for me even if it's baptised to look good.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is the glue that hold together. She is so humble that she allows Abraham to get the credit.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let us not mistake lack of self respect as being humble. She has low self esteem and low self worth to allow herself to be in this situation.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@blessedwachera7133 stop judging situations you are not privy to , she actually is the glue , sometimes strength is not what you would think she IS stronger than you can imagine"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not humility,it's low self-esteem,kukosa kukupenda,kujipenda important,not just allowing bad things in your life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful fam 💜 musipangwe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So he has not married any of them, they are all come we stay... smh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As for me, I cant, I dont believe this was founded on true love. MONEY! MONEY! MONEY! How many times did i call you? And the biiiibbbblie saaaayyys, The love of money is the root of all evil. Cerah you have a beautiful soul. Wishing this family all the best. Waah,, I cant!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Our fight back, is he fighting? Really? Until the women look for other values in other men. He should be the one talking. Waiting till another man comes into the family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Meeen this is so much crap! Following the story, this wasn't genuine. No proper communication to the first wife. No openness! The message the guy is giving from the story is 'I have another woman, I don't care, do what you gotta do' and because Serah didn't have an option, she chose to stay. The fact that Maureen states that she felt guilty shows how on all levels this is wrong"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope this selfish man loses both of the women.....I hate a man who plays on women's mind thinking he i can own anything any time
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wish you all the very best. Me i think this is just fine. You are ready to accept foriegn culture like lesbianism, homosexuality biasexual or whatever you call it and many more and you find fault with this??? I just can't imagine. God Bless your union and give you all more Grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wooiye Serah, I really feel for you. Men will always cheat but a man who truly love, care and respect you will never bring another woman into your home 😥."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapendi sarah dio maana love ilienda kwa moreen bt alikua anacheat. ukipenda sex saana lazma ujipate hapo
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are they twins..coz wanafanana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have been following these guys and I felt when Sera said her only luck is the husband. I wish she can follow Njeri Muigai find something else to give you joy . Find something else to divert your attention. Woiye this Abraham is so full of himself. Yani he is a narcissist. Toxic doing reverse psychology on Serah .
 Serah If you were my sister mmmh I will never allow such disrespect on me ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is difficult to watch- I may need a month to get to the end....Eish!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Ngugi you are an amazing interviewer. Thanks for the info. You have done well. Abraham  is a selfish man . Serah has seen it all. These two have always cheated on her. No Justification  for Maureen to steal someones husband  especially  serah who comes out as a home maker. Lets not sugarcoat. No married woman reading this deserves the Pain of polygamy betrayal and shattered children. This is Bullshit trying to justify it. The devil is a Liar in Christ  our marriages are Anchored. Why didnt maureen leave them when she came to know he is married. A third one will come to dethrone you Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,BETRAYAL! period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not close to being okay. Nothing is okay about all this and it's all over her face. But if she decided to stay that's fine. Also it doesn't sit right with me that Abraham is so much certain about what he's doing
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is manipulative and probably a womanizer!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish you interviewed them separately so that we could see their individual view of things
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From my observation,this guy will not allow Cerah to be interviewed separately. He doesnt even give her a chance to fully explain or express her feelings. He either jumps in or he and Maureen laugh her off. They have a way of down playing her feelings every time, leaving her with no option but to fake a smile too."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You're talking
q4sWUJxjc4g,I  have watched this story over and over my heart goes out to Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,For real 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The fact that the guy insisted on being the one to answer questions that are not even addressed to him speaks volumes on his charatxer. I see a man who is quite controlling. The ladies also kept asking "" I will let baba answer that "" 
Lastly, they would answer and confirm with him "" is that how we met? "" Is that how we started living together?"".
I ask myself if they're are genuine about what they are sharing it shouldn't be that confusing. 
Towards the end of the interview, Lynn has to insist let the ladies answer.  
From my opinion something is not right here."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Good that someone else noticed that too, the guy was disrupting conversations from the women, cutting their answers short everytime."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"courage, humility, and wisdom packed, just Art"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you Lynn for this interview.  It's heart wrenching watching Serah... She needs to heal. Both Abraham and Maureen are devious either way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sio kwa ubaya Maureen should just leave alone what God had put together
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish my co-wife  is watching this...am no better but it can work......
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow 👌 to the young family and what a great souls there this the love that is expected from us all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Here I see one very lucky guy
q4sWUJxjc4g,A bunch of hypocrites here blazing guns to the lovely family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is very beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Haki this guy is just pissing  me off 😪😪😪😪 eti anasema after them meeting he now "" officially has 2 wives"" wapi wame officiate? Kwa church or? Chaiii! sa mbona stress napata mimi kuliko Sera😣  😖"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weh! This is tough, I cannot cordon it. He cheated and that's that."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am glad Lynn interviewed them, but moving forward ,they need to stop this interviews- the more they interview the more they open those wounds  in Sarah,s heart  that have been bandaged. ❤️
I ❤️ Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Narsisstic Co wife and the so called man.... Who else feels serah was ordered what to say in this interviews, she feels like splitting up the truth but the dictatorship behind her🙄🙄🙄🙄serah one day you will find yourself again..... The way cowife trying to roll this English but haikunjiii😂😂😂serah all lots love 💞💕💖💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I admire this family , more men and women should emulate this family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a narcissist and a classic manipulator.Cera is too young for this nonsense and she is clearly getting finessed .Anyway it is very important to empower young girls so that they are able to stand up for themselves.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah body language says the truth 
She is not happy! Nikama tu mtu hakupewa hata haki ya utshakuzi 
Habraham ugelikua mtu wa uhaki nakumuambiya Cerah mbele awe mke wako kama wewe ume tshaguwa polygamie kama Cerah hangelikua mkewe. A true man fixe this before!!
Apana ii yakua na side chik kisha kuongeya bimoya hivi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Betrayal of the highest order from Abraham n the way cerah  seems to be a great wonan
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A very good thankyou to Lynn, you are asking all the right questions. At what time did you Abraham thought of taking another  woman to a coffee date when you have one at home? Why çant you go home and take coffee with your wife or you take her out? 
STOP FULLING YOURSELF ABRAHAM."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's still not easy for sarah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kindly Lynn follow this story haki
q4sWUJxjc4g,Islam allows 4 wives with a reason.Its better for him to marry than to cheat outside
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not okay with this marriage but she's trying to be happy but in her heart💔 it's very painful to her
q4sWUJxjc4g,He cheated. Period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men will always get away with even murder. But this is another form of immortality. Women take alot of shit 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is clearly faking her smile...... this women breaking other people's marriage I can smell fire for them....God Will punish you ruthlessly
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is not happy and she had no choice, either way second wife ,ppl will always look her like a home......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shalom Serah!shalom.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"LADIES LADIES LADIES 🗣️🔊🔊 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DATE A CONFUSED MAN. MIND GAMES DEEMED AS A FAMILY. 
THIS WILL NEVER BE OKAY. NEVER EVER. 
I KNOW EXACTLY WHY I SAY THIS. MY BIG BROTHER HAS 2 WIVES. EACH HAS 3 KIDS. EACH LEAVE SEPARATE HOUSES. AND I CAN TELL IT'S A STRUGGLE FOR ALL OF THEM. HE TRIED TAKING THE KIDS TO SAME SCHOOL BUT THE FIRST WIFE COULDN'T HAVE IT. SHE TRANSFERRED HER SON TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. THIS DEFINITELY AFFECTS THE KIDS. 
SEEING MY BROTHER'S LIFE AND NOW ABRAHAM'S LIFE I DO NOT WANT THIS KIND OF LIFE TO MYSELF. I'D RATHER BE SINGLE & GENUINELY HAPPPPPPPPPPYYYY. 
KWANI IKO NINI. RUSHENI MAWE NITAJENGA MEGA MANSION 😉😆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I swear you are talking the truth
q4sWUJxjc4g,are you somewhere around syokimau/Katani? for us to wait or the plane to pass
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We reject this in Jesus Name. 
If we accept this and many other abominations we will be punished as a nation, soon God will send fire balls on nations just like in sodom and gommorah
You don't know Who God is? 
His commandment says, thou shalt not covet your neighbors properties even their spouses. 
People stealing other people's things is part of the new world order, new liberal order where the commandments of God are made null and void."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham looks like he loves Maureen more 🤔but Sara is so sweet and calm. But all in all its thy are choice god bless u all
q4sWUJxjc4g,"On my side,the day my husband will start telling me he is getting married,I will move on with my life and give him the chance to marry as many women as he wants but I should not be among"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm sorry but this man is too proud and selfish! yani all this time I was hoping to hear a  valid reason to why he not only cheated on Sera but to go as far as having a baby with Maureen..@sera, you are such a strong woman..God will lead you,You are a good woman ❤💫 

sending love from Tz  🇹🇿💫❣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The narcissism, the betrayal, the manipulation! My heart weep for Cera. Oh God may you open her eyes. May you  financially bless her immensely and give her the grace to leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I had the same thoughts …like weeh
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True the guy is a narcissist,self absorbed."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To leave???? This is her empire for Pete's sake!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@bethtoox9435 and full of himself
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@rose_wangari No empire here,GOD is the empire,we humans r nothing,here it's toxic marriage,time will tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Two manipulators taking advantage of Serah. I hope she finds the courage to leave. Hugs
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are Africans and African culture is our business. Men as long as you are able to support the ladies marry as many as you can.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One followed this advice, HIV has destroyed what was left of beautiful humans.  Sadly I know them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are a happy family
q4sWUJxjc4g,Infidelity is infidelity...no matter what Maureen says you really caused Serah pain...she may not be speaking about it out but she is really heart broken.. Enyewe the name you give your child matters...Read about Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes Serah...going back to work would be perfect....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have gone through the comments and  one thing comes out clearly! Ladies are throwing a lot of stones.  But you will be surprised majority of them are side chicks to people husband, or have children with married men. Since I am not God, who am I to judge? Because when you judge, you'll also be judged."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah it's never late, save money and  go look for your happiness, God is of another chance, just trust the process"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is calm. Perhaps too calm. Abraham and Maureen may think they have her where they want her but they need to tread very carefully. They need not take her soft and calm demeanor forgranted. We all know about the straw that broke  the camel's back. May it not come to that. It's the gentle ones who scare me  more than the loud ones. Those still waters run deep!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Earth is hard !!!!! You can't love two ppl the same way never even prophets never had such capacity now my bggst qstn hw does he divide hz sexual needs adequately among them 😭😭it's painful you cant wish any of these to ur enemies. Nktttt that Maureen is selfish if the tables were to turn would she agree to wht she has done to smwn else
q4sWUJxjc4g,Stockholm syndrome happening here. Serah has her back on the wall. This is total BS. This guy pure narcissist. Maureen huge emotional manipulator. Sending you lot's of courage Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Keep moving
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is a cheat. so if  this man met another woman in his so called business who is Lyke Maureen he will cheat on both and marry her. Men?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Again women desperate themselves saying where will i start how will i pay school en feed kids what does windowed do for survival why should  i hold to man coz of bed en then be looked down like a begger
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is total BS,may we never encounter a man or a woman like these 2 wearing bright coloured tops,sera my heart breaks for you.I pray you find the strength to leave because clearly your the side chic in your own marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I come from polygamy family, My dad betrayed my mom and married our house-help, the drama in my family was unstoppable, toxic, hate, no peace etc.
My mom passed away last year with so much bitterness, sometimes my dad and his 2nd wife would gang on my mom.. It’s horrible experience when growing up.
Men stick with one wife."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My mum also comes from a polygamous family and I never liked my grandpa,I personally hate chaos and he would cause chaos in my grandmothers house while we were there on visits since we loved our grandma so much,I have no good memories about that man,I'd see him and run,and worst of all he beat my grandma and she has suffered for more than 30 years with spinal chord issues,my mum and her step brothers and sisters always fighting,wait until the day he died father Lord of heaven,his home was a war zone..and I happen to share the same thoughts with a friend whose father was polygamous he hates his late dad to date."
q4sWUJxjc4g,That was sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs dear iam from a polygamous family and married but the day the man will decide to marry is the day I will Walk away
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like the way u are talking out of experience,hugs honey"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am cutting onions,nikikumbuka Yale tumepitia kama watoto wa polygamy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's always smiling at Maureen... Sarah😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so nice🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am running to Abraham's Empire
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pole Sera.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,The two were sugar coating before cerah interjected.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really don't know what I can say about polygamy but I really love the reality in this family, they are beautiful but the truth of the matter is whatever you make your fellow human being pass through, one day one time God's time, you will pass through the same n yours will be worse. God feels our pain more than us, so let's not judge but wish them well n leave everything to God coz He Has a reason for everything 🥰🥰😘"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am confused about all this but cerah may you be wise! This works now but for the future not sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is beautiful than Maureen acha azae watatu achape Abraham aoe watatu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ndio hiyo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaaa Lynn, this is the most shocking show I have watched, whaaat, i still have questions, do they sleep in the same room ama different"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen u may not see it today bt that's a foundation u've laid for your generation n it might not be smooth. No matter how much u show us its OK God knows our actions
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati Cera hujapangwa na kukanyagwa? Hehe  they did that long time otherwise Maureen wouldn't be so comfortable with this arrangement!  Cera is hurting and she's bottling up alot and eventually she will burst..Abraham not having the desires of adding a third one ni  juu Maureen has everything that he couldn't find in Cera.  Anyway wishing them all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is beautiful inside out,We can only imagine her pain till she healed herself and accepted things.,their story is trending not because it's a beautiful thing but because it's weird,there are times a woman gets mad and tells you can marry the sidechick but more often she doesn't mean it,she need assurance that you still care and atleast apologize for your mess not actually bringing her for her to see everyday,or you would have consulted her and build her another home as per Kikuyu traditional,just wondering what all  your parents think about the whole set up🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This whole thing is about money parents will not say anything
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God teach me to mind my own business and not Judge... Yaani people want you to live according to their STDs  otek samoro
q4sWUJxjc4g,Parents does not care about a girl child if you cannot stay with your hubby they will frustrate you and your kids till you commit suicide. Very few in African set up can welcome their daughters back home.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Infidelity sugarcoated. The audacity in this man, aaaargh. And this Maureen girl 💔 I just pray Serah finds herself and a way out of this ...ship. Abraham you really betrayed Serah and you should be ashamed of yourself."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I better be a single mum than building a life with a man en then he just decides to love someone else on my eyes u can't love two women  at the same time
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even the cover page you can see how the husband preferred Maureen than Sarah we Mimi hii siwezi even if  Mimi si class yake weeee asinikose heshima hivi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not easy as they put it, they're all grown ups and let's take everything on face value. Happiness is a choice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Classic example of a selfish egocentrical man who wants to eat his cake & still have it. & for the man to sit there as if he was the prize is just pitiable! I wonder what the lesson in this story is.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Signs of the end times. Just like in the days of Noah. Lord Jesus is coming soon.
q4sWUJxjc4g,.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is that prophecy in the Bible
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is very inspiring, kudo kwa to Lynn,they did better in this Show than the other interview I watched in another channel.I think is the way Lynn is asking deep great questions. Lynn you are the best and I still love you mami💕❤️💕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you have a way to bring out people's hidden emotions, in this interview I've seen sera's side that she didn't show in the other interview s."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true...
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure talent
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The facial expressions cannot lie, no matter how much both ladies try to mask.  
Abram stop brainwashing- at because they are “light skin”- embrace African beauty. You have girls that are not light skin …. Internet never never forgets and hope your daughters will not pick up that section."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This dude will even bring a man next and you will still stay
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People will do what they want, and marry as soo many wives as they want, but nobody will ever change God's word, a man was created for one wife and together they become one, period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,From my side....I see a very greedy man....Sara work on self stability I don't sense love here in the next 2years.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wooi second wife is in their life what a shame
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes indeed if you look at Maureen as a sister and not housewife the hurt reduces. Otherwise internalizing that she is a co wife slaps differently. And you are spending too much time trying to make us understand- We won’t understand. And truth be told, second wives are not to build. Come on! Just do your thing sisters. Where is my mentor Benjamin Zulu????? Anyway I love your dimple Abraham."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truth be told here.. these married guys date using excuses abt their wives. Oh bibi yangu hayuko active kwa bed, oh hanipei styles nataka and lots of nonsense they say to win your mind... With no doubt, Maureen was given some of these lies ndo akaingia box... Immorality is against God's will, let's not praise it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Where is mama bear I love how she had to left a situation like
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My buggy question to men ,is what would will happen if we also do that to you ...we also have choices 🥺"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is very brave mum and God will rewards her
q4sWUJxjc4g,No lesson here just a story to justify men cheating on their wives.🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is honestly hurt,but afraid of starting again.The pain is so visible in her eyes and i truly feel sorry for her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also see that, she is just forcing smiles, poor her! 😢😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very true, she is hurt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,yeah she looks somehow hurt but its good she spoke out.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True I noticed too

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don say Sarah was OK she did it cos she didn't have a choice,wat if it were you?put yourself in her shoe"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really love how Lynn do these interviews, full of wisdom, love you bebgal❤❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Baba here fulus is good and Sarah hard no choice it's on here face
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My take,huyu Maureen angekaa kwa nyumba yake,atlst give second wife her space si poa vile amekuja kwa nyumba ya mwenzake🥺🥺"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is disturbing to watch.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kudoos wonderful family; I had my grandmothers who were too bonded and left their family bonded to date 21 years later since they all departed. May God keep you strong together till the end
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is nothing wonderful about this family. May God help them all see the light, and bring this charade to an end."
q4sWUJxjc4g,A phsycho
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sara is in an abusive relationship and trapped because of her kids as many women are around the world let's pray for her to grow a backbone.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera can you open your own YouTube channel to show your work am sure you will get alot of customers and we will support you too❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huuh my husband tried this na tulifight even before tujuane majina  for me its a Noo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn  this story line is not fit for your show,
Please God has placed you to uplift and build.
This is a very selfish man of a human being.
We can all see Sara's pain.
The two cheats are happy coz they got what they wanted."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is trying to communicate something when she says that they started from scratch and by joining him to chama  that's tells a lot asin Maureen should have kept off their  marriage,cerah one day you will find happiness start counting.....  and keep yourself in god's presence it may take time but God time yenye  atasema wewe Maureen utajua hujui......and by the way cerah you r very beautiful and young looking."
q4sWUJxjc4g,If ur the first wife Maureen ugekubali sara aolewe in ur home aki🤣🤣🤣imajin this 2 start dating this jamaa akiuza sukuma.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah just give up on the marriage,this trauma momma,as long as you have a job ,ask for a devorce , it's really desrespectful"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bro did you truly love your wife? I doubt. Feels like she was beaten to submission. Sarah lacks the backbone to stand up for herself and leave.. You can see her pain from betrayal..I hope her inner eyes can open up..Maureen preyed on someone's husband.. My take is that she should leave this family alone look for her own husband..let's call a spade a spade
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is just a liar. period!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not how God created it. Its against the Word and christian way of living!! No matter how u decorate it its against the Word and its wrong. U cant love two women the same!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know if I can handle such betrayal 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,No judging them as long as they're happy and make the family intact. Polygamy has been there for centuries is  better than lying all the time and when one dies then they start coming for his wealth and fights starts . He has made it clear let his Empire grow.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's a two way thing.Women are actually more polyamorous in nature, ni Ile huwa hawapayuki kila mahali.If you didn't know,now you know! Actually very serious!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Corinthians 7:2
But because there is so much immortality,every man should have his own wife and every woman should have her own husband.Mourine determine to have your own husband.A Abraham wife singular is what GOD want's but wives for plural is for  Satanic"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"40 rules of power ..keep Your friends close but Your Enemies even  Closer.
Sarah  has the strings..no need to pity her.
Its woman on top"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hahaha, eti you are a sinner? Haki i luv u Lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you Lynn Ngugi waaa leo nimeona huyu Abraham wanted to hear the story on the hoses side
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Smooth talker he is!!!! Cheating turned into polygamous thing, waaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone one here is on an exit plan
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, this is very beautiful 😍 life is all that we make it, i have my step mum and she is the best ever. Please let the family be, all sorrys cant stop or help them in any way."
q4sWUJxjc4g,How is your mom? Talk to her as a woman if she’s the oldest that is
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn's interviews is for people who are ready for tough questions if I was Abraham i would have walked away lakini thanks to our gal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah had no choice but to accept the new wife. She chose to stay. 
Abraham had a choice not to get into a second relationship.
He opened his heart to a second one..Will he get a third one."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm not against  the second wife because one the baby is already born , but I highly  support  and respect  the level  of communication  you involved 💯 👌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You messed up Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So you are all avoiding the fact that serah and moh looks alike
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder if serah could not embrase Maureen what could Abraham have done?? Looks like he would rather lose Serah than Maureen...Serah open your eyes gal
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My question is, if Abraham is no more, will the two continue living together and perhaps investing together? Maureen has one kid and Serah has 3, if they are investing the three of them, how will they share and won't there arise great enemity as a result of this?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is for mature women and monogamy for girls
q4sWUJxjc4g,Enyewe mapenzi wewe🙂 I'm okay after Cerah said she's fine.. all the best to you all as a family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sure, I have a feeling that Cerah uses that phrase sarcastically, she had a lot of love for Abraham who betrayed her, she must be hurt but very aware that with 'mapenzi' she cannot stop wat is between Abraham and Maureen. She is swallowing the bitter truth and tries to act maturely. 'Enyewe mapenzi Rita'"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is neglected emotionally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1Corinthians1:25
For what seems to be GOD'S foolishness is wiser than human wisdom.and what seems to be GOD'S weakness is stronger than human strength."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is so full of himself...the guts....pesa huisha tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We Africans hide pain with laughter,we are forced to say we are okey when we are not! Very low standards and self esteem for both Serah and Maureen!Typical greedy Man!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I pity Serah...i hope one day she get love of her life, this man doesn't love her but she is a good hearted gal"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham you had not finished the first wife dowry. Pole serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I REALLY FELT FOR 😪 😞 CERA SHE SAID SHE HAS NEVER BEEN LUCKY IN HER LIFE 😔 😪 HUGS MAMA its clear you were not even lucky in LOVE 
MAUREEN KARMA WILL SOON CATCH UP WITH YOU ITS A MATTER OF TIME inafanya press ups
ABRAHAM YOU ARE JUST SELFISH!!!! CERA dint deserve this 😤 😒 
Anyway let God be the judge"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You showed him you can peacefully live together he will definitely bring another too.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry to say Abraham loves himself first. He pursues what he want!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,OKAY I WAS READY SOMEONE....!!! IS AFRAID AND TRYING TO JUST BE OKAY.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Matthew 5:28
But now I tell you: anyone who looks at a woman and wants to possess her is guilty of committing adultery with her in his heart. Abraham You must know that possessing Mourine as a second wife is adultery.is written!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Things we do because of our kids ,I thought marriage was supposed to be between two people since it's an  a sacred altar"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Eves.This is not the initial will of God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,One day Serah will open her eyes. The look of betrayal and pain in her eyes!! Nobody wants a hotspot  #onewifeonehusband
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy just took advantage of Sarah calm nature
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The character of number 2, really Abraham, or it was number 1
From Sarah's body language and voice it is so obvious that it still pains her,  these women stayed with Abraham because their don't want to loose their kids, as they said ati the way he is with children,  Abraham they don't love you either.  Very disgusting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's boring to share a man but what can we do all men are pollygamist especially this error.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is very beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love  you Lynn Ngugi,  and the way you asked questions  I know there are some hidden  answers, if only we can see inside someone's heart....✍🏼I don't trust this Abraham , but I respect  Cerah she have a pure heart..✍🏼 #Namibia 🇳🇦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah God bless your kid and your family, tyme for hagai to go is coming"
q4sWUJxjc4g,1:09:22  😂😂😂 aki Lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is in trouble,they have developed their on bond,if he messes up he is in for a big shock."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is putting Cera in an corner always talking about Maureen poor Cera she is just there in the corner
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the response, serah does get sidelined. She is the one who said she reaches out when she feels so. The second wife doesn't have such problems."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not Maureen trying to adopt American accent
q4sWUJxjc4g,As a goat wife my heart is paining as if I'm involved in this case🥺🥺let me mind my own business anyway 🤸🤸🤸may be Sarah has a good plan for her future and that of her kids awaachanishe hapo😏😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't look like she had a choice here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Once your not satisfied with one woman,... You'll never be satisfied with 2,3,4...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's nothing to be happy about here💔, Sending hugs to you Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are right
q4sWUJxjc4g,but inakaa come back ya wao wawili inakuja tu.
q4sWUJxjc4g,very true

q4sWUJxjc4g,Woow that man is honest
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weee wee anywei i wont judge personally i cant entertain such but Serah you have a pure heart and you deserve all the happiness in the world,its good at times to put yourself first even if you will end up loosing someone its okay as long as you come first"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hakuna kupangwa !!!!💎
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What if Abraham has a kind, genuine and loving heaart unlike a thousand of you people commenting saying who is depressed, sad. Be kind and see love will be all over you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah, girl, run. You're young and beautiful, you'll find an amazing man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So you cheat, have a baby and when caught your first response is sitakufukuza???? All in the name of love!?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't believe people are not ok with Sarah bring Ok.Why should she leave and she was the 1st.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder if he would be comfortable with his daughter being treated how he’s treated his first wife. This man is selfish and self serving .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As far as choice is concerned I wish them all the best,,what I pray is Abraham to never forget to love them and treat them equally,,Love Sarah she deserves all the love,And love Maureen she is a respectful woman and Loving also and I pray that her friendship with Serah Lasts Forever 💎💎All the best .... Respect, communication, Affection, Affirmation,knowing your levels,unity,Equality and support is the key 🔐💎"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All I'm getting from this is BETRAYAL, someone left with no choice and a father Abraham with too much audacity. My two cents though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Acha niseme weuh ..juu weuh this needs extra ordinary breakthrough and grace to accept some things
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If your conscious is truly clear as a ""family"" then there's no need to seek public validation.Be true to yourselves and I don't think the public hates you on the contrary, you put yourselves out there for public scrutiny. Viewers share their reviews and so will I.Cera and Maureen are both beautiful in their individual personalities may God's true Will prevail amidst all the confusion."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"More wanting are the many that aare bashing the guy yet they're side hens elsewhere .... It's only God who knows the truth in this union ..... Afaithful man and Woman are always tempted in the school of marriage if you overcome the waves say Halleluhya .... U r just ok as a man/woman then the devil tempts you to a man/woman pap mmelala together before you know it you union is something else so let's stop harshing on the man and the other woman ..... Many are the times when men/women walkout of their marriges without solmenly ending it then into another believe me you your generation will never settle on issues marriage unless you have an a deeper intervention into this matter .... A good example are the men of God who ought to guide the gullible but they end up eating the sheep only to say in defence that all have fallen short of Gods Glory and there the congregation are like Ameeeeeen.  The white man brought us Christianity but we now pupport to know much than the Christian Colonisers ... Hiw along the way we forgot who we are our Africanism. Go check the native Americans they gave birth to more 5 or more children and here they're telling to do family plannig and give birth to one kid.
Sorry but a woman should have her montly natural flow(periods) coz those are toxics coming out of the bidy but you're busy preventing them from so doing thus the many abdominal ailments our lovely Women go through......

q4sWUJxjc4g,Gutiri Muthuri uthuire ng’ombe nyingi ni mahuti magaga 🤓
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beautiful family congratulations
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So someone can cheat on you and when you confront them they are not even sorry about it?  Funny enough, the first wife is more attractive than the other lady.

Serah, you are a beautiful lady and you deserve better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yap...she is more pretty
q4sWUJxjc4g,I notice too
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have never understood how people are so judgemental... When we all sin differently.. shame on all of you . Sera is not stupid she is very intelligent.. if she wanted to go she would have left
q4sWUJxjc4g,Our grandfathers were polygamous. One thing they did was to build each wife a house. Lets not lose tradition as this setup is painful to one party. I hope the first wife loves herself more to walk away or demand better.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sure co-wives is a ""pot of poison"" as the saying goes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My great grand father had six wife that's what I hear ,but come my grapa had one because of what they went through ,many turn to witchcraft to manipulate the man, even now it cannot work let's stop the liar ,if u disagree with blood sis ,what about a stranger,haki Dunia ni ngumu better to leave n give them space, for your peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@lifewithtshidiedza381 why are you assuming they didn't want to be in the marriage?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! At least will still have sobber men around
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hearing this from a man is so heart-warming, listening to this I was like, may God give Cera the courage to walk away, she deserves better, she needs peace, she needs to love herself again, it's not easy to decide to just walk away, but it's the best decision she can make for her and her children"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I Don't know who else thinks like me if my man came today and told me he wants to  Bring in another woman I'd accept n it doesn't mean I'm weak...mrushe  mawe mchanga Niko nayo already
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, you're the best interviewer, you asked the right questions. This Father Abraham is so heartless and a narcissist. !. Maureen and him deserve each other. Hope Cerah will find herself worth and happiness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most women feel it for Sarah and on the other side hungry men anlre supporting father Abraham yet they can't feed themselves.
Kama huwezi jifeed don't even try to envy this.
Most men are so irresponsible yet they want to have this"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woiiiyeee lonely serah may Yu find Ur own husband 😢😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sara's mitigations were purely for her kids purposes.
Her emotional and mental stability is something to be praised.
Moureen story in Sara's home is a short lived one.....soon it shall be gone.
Heko kwa Sara.....your game is just on another level."
q4sWUJxjc4g,may God give serah the grace to fast and pray for God's intervention and this Maurine will leave... the husband is hers alone..serah is not happy...she has  no choice..one day  God will prove marriage is for the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,serah is hurt..her eyes say it all...

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I pray that cerah finds hapiness and joy within herself, she should not have invited Maureen into her home."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What the man did was wrong. It is obvious sarah has compromised alot. When this man dies (God forbid),we will see how genuine this relationship is between Sarah and Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I thought the same but God forbid
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One thing I love about Abraham is that he is not violent, some men when they realise their wife know abt their mistresses they become abusive"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometines mental abuse is worse than physical violence.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You think he was calm as he's saying on the interview? I think Cerah was even afraid of asking about Maureen cos she new his narcissistic behavior n she opted to kunyamazia for the same of peace. Abram is a manipulator
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what is abuse according to you...you think she just said yes coz she loved the whole idea
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This marriage,is not GOD'S doing as Abraham says,GOD is not their,1Corinthians7:2,Hebrews13:4-5 the Bible is our,life manual."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First, he can't even get her name right.. Cera not Sarah. This guy and Maureen are such liars.. you can tell their relationship started Kitambo, probably even when Cerah was getting her baby, the two were already together.  This man was ready to lose Cerah and the baby, by even deleting his baby's pictures, and he clearly said he loves Maureen and she ain't going nowhere. Why is Cerah still in this mix up?. Gal, you're too beautiful to be facing this mathogs, just move on with your babies. This two people are just fooling you.!. Nkt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't want to pretend and I can't pretend and don't  like pretenders...serah doesn't have a choice and I feel so much for her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I won’t be surprised if he has another woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is crying with me?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham, u are a great man. keep the family together, don't go 4 the third wife please."
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God liberate women from such slavery. At least have separate homes. I simply can't
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't really care how much this is sugar coated 🚮🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow!I love this I just wish that my case can be like theirs...coz mimi na mke mwenye ni stima na maji
q4sWUJxjc4g,"HEEEEEE lynn,leo umetoa the real feelings za serah....she is soo sad,may our good lord come to her rescue,i wont judge maureen pia but heeee c she was of great age kujua kutozaa na bwana ya wenyewe,thn tht abraham guy,alipata pesa ikakuja pia na nyege,the hatred i feel for him,lakini REKE HINJIO NI MAKWA BUUUT!!!! I CAN NEVER WILL NEVER TOLERATE WAT SERAH TOLERATES!!DEAR LORD,never make me overlove someone tht much,pliz dont ever let my daughter ever tolerate tht if i will ever have one in future,and the sons you have given me,pliz dont ever let thm do that to any woman...someone help me in shouting a big ameeeeeen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This conversation is triggering. When two people decide to make an innocent soul's life a living hell. They are forcing Sarah to live with their selfish desires. So sad that's the plight of sooo many wives. Let's wait for number three to be introduced.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nobody can force a grown up woman to live any situation, if she doesn’t want to. She has a choice to leave or stay. It’s all about what she believes. If a woman believes she cannot make it in life alone, then she will take any abuse and disrespect just so that she can stay with a man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man isn't stopping soon. Woman number three is definitely somewhere in the picture. It's just a matter of time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah should empowered
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This living arrangement won't work, at one point the 2 wives will get tired of each other. They'd rather hv 2 different households. Even our fore fathers had multiple wives and each wife would hv their own house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's NOTHING to glamorize here. He's a cheating husband who had a child with his mistress.  Call it what it is!
q4sWUJxjc4g,And then he brought his mistress and their baby home to live with the wife. 😡
q4sWUJxjc4g,"At whatever cost Biblically Sarah is the wife ,, Maureen is an intruder and a destroyer of Sarah s marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God of heaven it's  fun watching,I  Lynn show but this one no ,may my daughter never ,N God forbids ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There're some things people will never understand not unless there're in the situation....I always leave judgement to God 🙏
Nice interview Lynn n all the best to this family 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah doesn't  look ok at all it's sad that people  believe  they should  cry in dark and give a smile at lime light😭God give you strength  serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wishing them all the best in life
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow,wow. May God help the 1st wife. As a woman myself, I just couldn't imagine what she has gone through mentally to build a family and a home then you have to run the same home the two women. 
You have to accommodate someone else's lifestyle, choices, habits. Oh God."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The whole story just feels so wrong. This is sugarcoating infidelity. What would really stop that man from picking up a third woman?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks young than the other one
q4sWUJxjc4g,For sure as a human being I can't judge any of those guests coz we are all not perfect in the ''FLESH'' but I would have loved if  those guests had been more vulnerable and admitted the real challenges and consequences they have faced as a result of their decisions so that they can inform and educate us who may fall into the same dilemma after all  lynn ngugi's show to me is all about picking some lessons from people's mistakes and achievements but by their facial expression it seems to me their words are kind of contradict what exactly is on their deep inside  (HEART).......most especially Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray that one day Sarah will understand she's just used as third wheel. She might got herself to this because of fear what people Will say.she is still in confusion  mood one day she will know her value.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn plus interviewing is a completion of everything
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not to be judgemental but what kind of nonsense is this...
q4sWUJxjc4g,OH gracious God save us from such men in Jesus name!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart aches for cera... she is actually very strong to stomach all that.
Spread your wings mama...as for Maureen and the husband they are both very selfish if she was genuine she would have ended the relationship immediately she knew he was married....
Am a very sad woman watching this 😔😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Isaiah 4:1
In that day (end times), seven women will take hold of one man and say, ""We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!""
The only thing women can do is pray that this scripture is not fulfilled with u, cos like all Bible prophesies, it must be fulfilled."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What do you expect from father Abraham.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Fools be like Serah anajifanya 🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is a very beautiful lady and calm,  Maureen is only light but not beautiful,  they took advantage of Sarah's heart, I wonder Maureen could not find herself a man to steal someone's husband,  poor Sarah,   this Abraham man is just a manipulator , and  adulterous man wobis judt selfish, he is also a gold digger man of men version of slayqueern."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like Maureen audacity,,she is loving,and she respects Serah and looks like they are good friends,,but to be sincere am dissapointed with Father Abraham,""before saying they got a kid with Maureen,I have things to make clear to Serah""that point breaks my heart and gives a feeling of selfishness and ""lack of love to Serah or rather little or less or insufficient love for Serah ""That is so painful and Serah still remembers that very day and cry 😢 Serah all is well all will be well big up to Maureen for being a good friend to Serah💎🤕"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"aki Sarah ,may God give you strength 😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think you can care about 2 people and thats how you can live with them at the same house,if they are willing to share you.some time you can find a woman who keeps you smile and makes you feel proud of your self....or a woman who is making you work hard and makes you follow your path....if you can have them both and be truefull,then you can have a great future with them,if you they willing to live together as one family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have felt ""lack of love"" when he gave the consequences of saying he has a kid with Maureen 😭 Before explanaining it to her,,That is the painful thing that would ever happen on earth 🤕🤕Serah is so strong 💎"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cringed. ZERO regards to her feelings. Hampendi hata kidoooogo.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so wrong man. SERAH POLE BUT AT SOME POINT U HAVE TO KNOW UR VALUE AND SET SOME STANDARD I HOPE UR HAPPY AND NOT FAKING HAPPINESS.

q4sWUJxjc4g,What's the moral of the story
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ohhh nowadays we are looking ""beyond love"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Good questions Lynn, keep it up ♥️♥️♥️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah was really betrayed, had so much pain and l know she went into depression."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is infact my cousin and i respect his way of life if it makes all of them happy...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Money is everything 🤏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"at times when you do not have an option,accepting and pretinding that everything is okay is the only option you left with.thats my take...i highly doubt that serah is okay"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sharing one roof with my Co wife is a NO
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am listening to Maureen sanitizing second wives and demonizing single mothers... She went ahead to get a baby with a married man, to prove what? .. In fact, she's the only one wearing the ring.
Ati Mapenzi wewe? This is a toxic relationship.. One of betrayal, hurt, trauma bond"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is very painful 💔 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,My sentiments: I pray my daughters will know they're enough (empowered) not to put their worth in a man and not to tolerate somethings in the name of 'mwanamke ndio kujenga boma' and I PRAY PRAY that my sons will be impacted with the knowledge to know how to treat a lady in a Godly and not selfish manner and do away with this notion ' wanaume Huwa hawatulii' . It sickens me how we are okay with men being selfish and yet encourage our daughters to tolerate that selfishness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you for saying what needs to be said. We love sugar coating immorality. Abraham is being hailed as a hero who is successfuly maintaining two women. But he is just a promiscous man, who cheated on his wife, had a baby with his mistress, then brought her home, and now call this a marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"O
O"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wewe Maureen live for cera hubby look for urs.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah you are too beautiful for Abraham.. he should feel lucky he won you in the first place.. he deserves that old Maureen lady..you deserve better.. true definition of beauty! I wish you well
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pure crap! Jipange to leave Cera. This is not your portion, no."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am wondering if they sleep in the same bed and he starts with one and turns to the other. Living in the same house is madness and will confuse their children as they grow older. If he is a true man he can build two houses for them in the same compound just like used to happen in the early days polygamy then his house in the middle. If he does not know how his tribe did it a tour of the traditional villages at the bomas of Kenya will educate him.  He can marry as many as he wants but let him be man enough and  state from the start before he marries you. Cera how could you clean a man's house the first time you went there????  now he took you for a cleaner and has married one to have fun with. Whether you are happy or not I can't judge but your actions portray a desperate woman and the way you are young and pretty.
However I think this story is not true they are just trying to earn money through their YouTube channel and coz this might confuse the young gals  it's time every mother with daughters teach them never to stoop that low."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Clearly you can tell Sera was forcing a smile all through the interview and she is still hurting. She needs healing. She was forced by circumstances to accept and stay. Mapenzi wewe! From the beginning, she supported this man to grow and become the man he is today so she really invested in their marriage.. they have three children together, anaenda aende wapi? The other woman moved in Cera’s home, reasons only known to her.. Sisi wanawake tunajijua, lets not pretend. Sera is very beautiful with a warm welcoming heart, one can easily take advantage of her. Am not hating on Maureen in any way but something ain’t right with her. Namuonea 18. For Father Abraham, pesa wewe!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah look younger than maurene
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn good work interview I judged this family so much but hearing the story I love how he can manage the 2 wives please 2 ND wives who are judging this family let's learn from Maureen she shows respect to 1 st wife and her kids sorry ☺️ God bless this family let's mind our own business 😜
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah may say she is okay but deep down her heart is broken but she can't show it.... because even if she open up , Abraham won't leave maureen because he said it....it's a tough journey to serah  but it's okay lazima life goes on"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, no one should justify Sin, adultry/immorality is wickedness no matter who does it and for whatever reason 
Soon and very soon, God is gonna Strike if they do not Repent and Maureen; leave Sarah's Marriage, you have hurt her enough already 😢 
She is acting Safe for the sake of her Children and her Marriage, infact She is the one who Loves her husband 
This guy is using you for her business 
It won't take long, God will Justify Sarah and you will be out with your Kid 
Malipo ni hapa hapa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My grandfather had two wives.he died when he was 95 yrs and the two families still fought during his funeral on which compound he should be buried.polgamy is painful.but again it actually depends.i have watched this family, and much as I feel bad for Sarah sometimes,I think they are genuinely committed to this lifestyle and there's alot of mutual respect and love among these three.obviously one part will get less or more in one situation or another.but am actually surprised am not against them.life ain't that complicated if harmony prevails and mutual respect prevails."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes they can have that mutual respect but what about serah's emotional damage... That can last for a very long time...

q4sWUJxjc4g,@@DaughterofChrist215 same case ..the amount of hatred competition jealous cannot be explained
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just pray this last forever becoz I feel anyone can find themselves in this situation. I cnt judge and I will not judge. Wishing the family happiness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loved Maurine coz of money
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In God's eyes it's unacceptable and breaking of His sovereign will for marriage, no matter how well displayed this story is, The truth is this is betrayal of trust and dignity on Cera's part honestly. God see cera through.❤️❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's okey, they're happy it's one big happy family that we should embrace in the society everyone deserve love and every child deserves parental love all the best Abraham's family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Don't say that the society should embrace this! Corporate sin, is still still. God will punish entire nations for endorsing and accepting abominations very soon. 
You don't know Who God is? 
His commandment says, thou shalt not covet your neighbors properties even their spouses. 
People stealing other people's things is part of the new world order, new liberal order where the commandments of God are made null and void."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks you  yaaani people comment like they are holy you would be suprised they are in many private relationships then when this Abraham puts his life in the open He is condemned. Better an open polygamous man than a fake monogamous relationship... People expect war here so when they don't see war they feel it's not right
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@janetillah7720 yah  people should learn to accept things as they're and move on.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why are we judging them? Nothing is wrong there, it's African style. I salute Sarah for protecting her marriage. Lynn I love the way you nailed it 💕😘"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is nothing cool in Polygamy. The guy legitimised his immorality behaviour. He looked for an excuse in Serah to cheat with Maureen.He is a self centred person who want everything to himself.On Serah,she was afraid of her man sleeping out and probably losing him to Maureen. She was left with no choice but to act cool and accept Maureen and welcome her to their home to save her marriage but it can clearly be seen from her facial expression she's struggling to be happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Great interview Lynn!

 The man is a narcissist. He cheated on his wife. He loves Maureen, he left his wife for her. He won't be satisfied with those women, soon or later he will be on the road looking again.

Sarah is unhappy of course,  very low self-esteem. I really feel for her. She always looked down, her laughs were full of hurts  and sorrow. She is extremely confused. YOU CAN DO BETTER SARAH!. He doesn't love you. You are beautiful and  intelligent !

Maureen is in denial! her answers to the questions were pointless,  always beat around the bush! Her famous lines ""I am not the kind of person"". "" I am not a home wrecker"" I didn't come to destroy Sarah"" You repeated the questions to yourself . You were unsure of your own answers. You took another woman's man! He left his family for you! 

KIDS ARE INNOCENT THOUGH. I JUST HOPE THEY WILL GROW UP AS GRATE YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN, WHO WILL CHERISH THEIR VALUES , SELF-RELIANT and break this cycle!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,Facts. There is no happiness here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Correct, Serah has zero esteem"
q4sWUJxjc4g,IIs this the first polygamy you have ever seen? Are all polygamists narcissists?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki love and hugs to you  Cera I really envy your heart ❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wouldn't want to have a heart like that aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am that person who does things in the best way I know how without minding what the society says and on that note,if Cerah, Maureen and Abraham are happy with the arrangement who am I to say No. Happiness counts more than anything.Abraham is just an awesome man.Let's stop the hypocrisy and face the the reality, they are living a reality and I wish them the very best from the deepest point of my heart.To you Maureen,Kaa kidete na uamke urudi job. Live your life the best way you know how?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my opinion, I don't understand why this story needed to be covered, a story about a man preying on the vulnerabilities of his partner so as to be able to do whatever he pleases. What message is this sending to our girls ?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would say it is a good illustration of what not to do.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Tate thanks for your opinion, truth be told they should not seek for validation over infidelity from followers whether it’s smeared with butter it’s still very wrong never okay"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It might be a wake up call to some of us...

q4sWUJxjc4g,It's better this way than kuwa na mipango ya kando
q4sWUJxjc4g,My mum welcomed another woman into her matrimonial home and we her children lived to regret this. She was not given the choice to say no the decision had already been made so I believe that Sarah is at a corner that forced her to either accept Maureen or loose everything she has worked for.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The body language of first wife tells it all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometimes I wonder what some men want because Cera is more beautiful  than Maureen by far
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love this so much..seeing the friendship btwn the two women give me goosebumps..coming from the same family set up with two wives where they have never got along, this is just lovely and recommendable"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera looks manipulated she kept looking at the husband for confirmation I think she can’t decide on herself. He took Maureen because he knew he can build himself money wise through her n Business wise. If he spends more time with Maureen at work he should take cera for dates for equality. First wife doesn’t look happy the guy knows how to panga her the guy made clear that second wife was not going anywhere first wife build her home from scratch she couldn’t leave it to someone else.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I honestly think it's about communication and understanding. What Abraham did is a bold move, Serah has the biggest heart to accept the husband loves another Lady and embraced more than her desires. Well, for Maureen she's a brave and a blessing  too for being able to come in and be part of the family. All in all, polygamy has been there and will still be, but for it to work well, there must be total honest  , communication and consent.

I would love to hear from them 10 years down the lane.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"How was what Abraham did considered brave? He cheated then when Sera saw the pic and confronted him, he confessed. That isn't bravery. As for Maureen being a blessing and brave? Where was she a blessing? Did she bless their marriage by sleeping with Abraham or? Was she brave when she continued going on those 'coffee dates' with Abraham when Sera had just had a kid. ?"

q4sWUJxjc4g,One thing I have noticed with this women they are not beggars . Most this poor women are the one say I can’t be second wife and u are there as mpago getting casual sex
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you said you  are a believer, the only guide we have is scripture and we see God  made one wife for Adam. Jesus confirmed that this was still God’s will Matthew 19:8.  Do unto others as you would want them do unto you. Whether you have one  or more wives life will sometimes give you lemons  but the choice is yours to make lemonade and not go looking for oranges. No other human can complete you. 
Ok mess happened and you fathered a child with Maureen, you could have owned up and taken care of your child without marrying Maureen. We tend to look down on that shoe that has walked the tough journey because it’s a little worn out and the excitement to wear it is no longer there. You cherish and are excited at the new one forgetting that it will get old one day. I don’t know if Maureen would have felt the same way if she had met you before you made it as an entrepreneur (truth be told money can give one an edge of likability) but you know Cerah did and would stand by you no matter what. Yet, you were willing to let her go if  she didn’t accept your new flame, That was sad!!! You like gave her an ultimatum, you wronged her and should have reassured her of your love for her and apologize for betrayal (Serah is an amazing person you have a true gem in her )
Hapa I am not judging you, I have listened to what you stated and my hope for you Is that you may take time to seek God and find His will in this matter. It’s better to loose the world and not loose your soul. 
I don’t think you are bad people but some ways may seem right to man but they may not lead us to our God ordained purpose."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God knows how much I want to slap that Abraham. Too much toxicity akh............am so sorry sarah. May you find peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sa he's toxic in what way?
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@presdice6046 That man had a choice of discussing with his wife on  whether to take a second wife but he chose to cheat and got a baby and then is when his wife knew and even after that he didn't care ....According to me that's toxic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Religion brainwashed African women It must be me who will marry ur sisters
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is not giving cera time to speak for herself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the body language, this man loves his second wife more. 
He is focusing too much on her.
I support one man one wife...
Iam widowed and l trust God for a husband but not another woman's hubby. Please God"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a man of peace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I thought this was just another interview. However, Lynn I now understand why your show is different. Great perspective 👌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,People like to criticize what they don't understand so people are here saying eee serah pole ee she's hurting now if I may ask so mngetaka atoke akuwe single watoto bila baba ama mungetaka morrine akae bila mume if they are happy am happy and they're not hypocrite men are cheating day and night and I clap for him for standing for his family and happy and proud of the two women that are not fighting sharing is caring
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@florencegathoni810 I pity your thinking.Such a desperate wordings from you.Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
q4sWUJxjc4g,No body is perfect. If the guy is supporting his kids. Kudos 👌. Wanawake hata wa bwana mmoja wameteseka
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cant even watch it to the end
q4sWUJxjc4g,The thunder that will fire you Abraham and Maureen is doing press-ups @Timbuktu... With your evil smiles 😡🙄🙄 thank God Sarah  is calm.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love this girl Cera,  she's soo cool 😎 and I know behind her heart ❤️  there's a wound 💔 of her loving husband's betrayal 💔. 
She's a hard worker and has her own company and that's great 👍 👌 .
This man Abraham may end up bringing another woman but I thank God Cera can hold this but I doubt Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm sorry to say but Abraham is trying to justify his infidelity. Sarah on the other hand  is too accommodating and is afraid of losing her family. Such a shame 😞
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for serah, may God come through for her. She's not happy at all.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""Abraham always talked highly of Maureen""...aiii!!Mimi ndingehota...pretense aside."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I repeat this is madness🙄🙄pretending to be un apologetic mmh  they are the only once who knows what is in their hearts individually and that will always remain as a personal secret till they die we arr grown ups and we know how hearts works when it comes to matters of love so we all know the feelings here don't try to convince us otherwise no matter how you try to spice it  we know the truth  it's not funny and it will never be funny i even feel the laughter so irritating to be precise.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"*WARNING*  📢 🚨 SO MANY *JEALOUS* ,  *SINGLE*  , *BARREN* , *UGLY* , *BABY MAMMAS* and *DIVORCED WOMEN* IN THE COMMENT SECTION ! ...🤣🤣🤣🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will bring da third wife soon just chill Maureen will suffer en feel same thing seera went  thru for sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,When all refer to the bible Sarah was  meant for Abraham and not Haggai....And I don't want to be say that Abraham is only focusing on Haggai...Hata Haggai akiongea  Abraham anamwangalia more than Haggai na kicheko funny funny hata Abraham amesika haggai vizuri.....Sijasema mtu am only referring to the bible..The God is sarah will still come ..kiboko lazima Haggai atapata
q4sWUJxjc4g,love you lynn but this is nonsense.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love for men is not same love in women that why man can date more than five women. If all women understand this single women will reduce in Kenya
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyne thumps up on the way you have questioned these people it has brought out a lot of truths and hurts that they have been covering. All I have seen here is two people who were cheating on a naive lady who when she got to know of it was helpless and had to let them to come into her her house and continue doing what they were doing now under her watch still hurting and evidently hurting. The guy also has no remorse about how she handled her when she found out. It’s just one year let give them time please bring us this story  a few years down when the two women will be willing to come out and tell the real truth about what this toxic situation will do to them. It’s also sad about what cera believes about her self  by saying “have never been lucky in life…..this guy is the only lucky thing I got” really?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That “lucky thing” got to me too.” How about her mother, father, brothers, sisters, grandparents, cousins, friends, teachers, neighbors, employer...... isn’t she lucky to have any of them in her life? Or is she talking about money? Is money the only thing she cares about? Women learn to value yourself, and those around you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Research show that most Kenyan women are ok to be second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Our grandparents used to have this type of life mature women
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham there is no respect ,no honor . Serah you are beautiful and you deserve better than this POS ….. who is soooo
Selfish…… find too gal
And run 🏃‍♀️. This guy is narcissistic and you are a result of circumstance. You are greater and stronger than you think ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are both very genuine and sweet ladies.  Hard to understand the whole situation though.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is horrible.i cannot understand it and will never
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Me trying to understand the "" blessing in disguise"" phrase from this man who caused an emotional torture to Serah . Let's be honest Serah's wish wasn't to have a cowife , clearly it was to spend the rest of her life yeye na mbaba wake . But naye Abraham na infidelity ni nani"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sharing is caring tell that to women of today they will walk out like karua
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The three had choices to make before this. You are married and you meet a lady you like, it is you to make the right choice to stick to your wife and marriage.  A married man approaches you, you have a choice to not accept and pray while waiting for your man and marriage.  Marriage is ordained for two, husband brings in another; it is controversial but ask for divorce for him to continue with the new catch. But all this will be avoided for the first wife, if the husband and new catch made the right choices. I don't understand the value part of Abraham as he tries to justify marrying Maureen. Phew 😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Big up to Serah,but i dont think if Mouren was the first wife she would have allowed Serah.I think Serah has a pure heart"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If it was Maureen who was in Sarah's place as a first wife, she couldn't have accepted Sarah to Begin with,  the Man on the other side is selfish proud and a betrayer. I really feel for the first wife she has to go through this kind of  humiliation from this two, Abraham and the co.wife who shamelessly moved in to stay with them. Abraham takes Sarah for granted her calmness and maturity is on another level. She didn't deserve this kind of mental torture from a man she calls her husband. I feel for her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pesa pesa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah be blessed dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife I feel for her anavumilia alot  she just hides it all aki wanaume

Ama ni Mimi naona vibaya😂

q4sWUJxjc4g,This is adultery....a product of lust. Nothing commendable but a dire need of repentance and reformation for this to just stop. May our good Lord in His mercies convict you of this sin. Do not harden your hearts
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's a gud family but all in all Abraham and Sara make a  lovely couple lyk wanamatch
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera I love you big . Your wisdom is beyond understanding .

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Whichever way this is painted or retold....it rings of betrayal, breaking trust, overstepping boundaries and a whole lot of selfishness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They are okay being two wives for him,but they are not okay if he was to add a third wife,sasa the same energy you have for refusing a third wife,it is the same energy we have for refusing a second wife.....eti he looks contented🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,u think he can say that ataongeza watatu mkiwa hapo......jipangeni kupanua group because a 3rd and fourth one is coming to join and let's see if you will be able to put all those smiles up like that......and the way you are advertising him on social media,other women are seeing there next target(he is weak)so if more can give him more happiness,they why not.......ni vile tu nimeokoka,otherwise.......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 na hakuna verse ya biblia mtatumia kuniambia eti we don't want you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ancestral polygam, cover up for lust. Its a curse.No happiness here. Business minds not love. Serah i feel for her!Lets support her business!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you were born a journalist,you’re such an amazing interviewer,Cera I know you said you are happy but deep within you’re the only one who truly knows,May God help you to overcome everything not only now but in the next 10 plus years"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This interviews have given Serah a chance to understand what really happened, because from the look of things she didn't have the courage to ask Abraham, her eyes can clearly tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true....she's still hurt
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,True dat
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's married to both of em
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves Cerah and is using maureen for his business but i can see so much  pain in cerah.maureen its not too late to leave that marriage!! Go and find someone of your own!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Glow on Lynn hay bo sisi❤️❤️❤️🇿🇦
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My take: NOT FOR ME, NOT MY PORTION!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The first lady is beautiful,looking so young,she has kids, hardworking ,mbona umletee bibi ya pili?? Akh men will never settle...from scratch mmetafuta na yeye then boom another person gets in after youv'e succeeded ... but one this i know whichever name you give yourself second is always second"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When I come on issue of polygamy,being avictim,there are two issues pple should know,love being a point,and peace being the other factor!the factor of love should not be nowhere to be discussed,peace is the supreme factor here!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is very evil with very bad heart, seriously if he put himself on this beautiful soul shoes, I don’t think if he could handle this situation. I see the heart broken clearly on her face. Imagine someone telling you I’m in love with someone else, without even being scared, some men will reach heaven when they are so tired. Abraham God is watching you, if you think is very easy for your wife to carry that mess, I want to let tell you know clearly is not easy at all. Sera has exactly situations I passed through. But mine it was different, I couldn’t take it I have to filled the divorce. Sera sweetheart, I don’t know what made you stay on that mess. But I pray for you sweetheart, God give you the strength, I know you are faking about to be ok with the situation, but deep down you’re dying inside my love. God will heal your heart my love, just continue to be strong."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is so wrong ,biblically, morally etc my heart goes out to the young girls who are watching this and would think it's okay to stay in such an arrangement. I mean even watching this interview is uncomfortable .You watch this with your daughter as you tell her how this is sick and wrong.I wouldn't give these ones airtime for the sake of the younger generation,they should be hidden.Above all,there's a lot of pretense hidden in the smiles.Gods plan sticks forever,Man and wife not wives.The man is wrong, the woman who chooses to stay in this is unbelievable."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only thing that Sera imagined would work for her.. is showing love and respect to Maureen.. because Abraham refused to let go.. me it's a no if love imeisha Kwa mtu.. let them go..... Don't deny them choices... Remember we can't fight for so long......
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is total bullshit in this era. The 1st wife is never happy but has to contend to save her marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is better than having side chick
q4sWUJxjc4g,The pain that Serah is masking through this whole interview is just alot. God grant you grace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no trust in marriages.you try your best but still men looks for other women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is the stranger in this family they are living she is surviving
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@peshmuchiri9814 woie...

q4sWUJxjc4g,@@violetaseyo5005 it is painful so painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very  true 👍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Deep down this guy should know that he took Sarah through hell..the second wife shouldn't be happy about all this,she got involved with someone's man.sarah had to accept coz she just fought not to be overtaken by another woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Every person is entitled to their opinion.Those saying that the Man Loves Maureen more than Cera it's all in their mind.At this point I think it doesn't matter the number one is in a man's life provided you are happy.Wish I had seen this 5 yrs ago.All i see here is a happy family.I wish them more happiness
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if she gets herself a boyfriend
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki how do i share a husband like a piece of cake?!me i can't watch this sorry i don't want to know my husbands ex.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah had to sit there and hear how her husband and his side piece met weeeeuuuh and the good moments they shared
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let’s face it. The man is always the problem and the second wife rides on the man because of the benefits. 
Sadly it’s as clear as day and night Sara is hurting while Maureen & Abraham are madly in love!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah ...she is so beautiful and kind
q4sWUJxjc4g,God made a marriage for one wife one husband. In God’s eyes serah is the only wife the whatever Maureen is an outsider. Home wrecker. He took advantage of serahs politeness. God will deal with u. Making her go through pain with ur mistress. She had no choice but to accept the filthy act
q4sWUJxjc4g,"#swolling pride i'nt fattening, Abraham mwangi""....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God,,,,,,,people are too judgemental,,,,me l love the family and whatever she decided,,wacera and Maurine,,, you are the best,,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is he giving examples with maureen.. weeehhh mimi nijikute
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even though it's not fair for Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera I can relate to your story when kids involved is not about you anymore is about the kids 
But my dear you're not in a relationship with your husband you're in a  situationship 
I can understand to keep your husband in the house you need to bring in Maureen

q4sWUJxjc4g,"2 questions for character check of the 2nd woman 1. Did you know he was married? 2. Did you know he had a family.? The answers will tell you that both Maureen & Abraham have no character & deserve each other. Sarah move on you're worth much more than this ""slave conditioning"" toxic situationship."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said👍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Love is blind, deaf and dumb as they say!! Kudos to this angle and beautiful hearted lady Cera!! I can't stand in her shoes ever for a minute!!! I didn't know the're some nice souls in this world!!! I think Abraham and Maureen take her kindness for a weakness! God bless you Cera...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No true love is never blind ...lust is blind ..this man and the co wife will pay for this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let's empower Serah spiritually emotionally & financially to leave this toxic situationship.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati serah alizoea? Serah is humble, Serah doesnt have any problem with that. Why are they speaking for Serah. Hope she finds her true voice."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dear Cera...Not good at all... but how did  you get to baby number 3 with a cheating husband.   Babies are good but it gets harder to move out with many kids . work very hard to grow your business just incase. The pain on your face is clear you are starting to see a light and I hope one day it will dawn on you that ulichezwa .  Its clear Abraham married you because you have qualities of a good wife not because  of love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,🥺😳 NO I CAN'T This is so sad.. anyway.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn this must have been a very challenging interview to bring out some frankness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Of course you are the father to your kids what else??
q4sWUJxjc4g,So she wasn't enough...men will never be satisfied...I can't settle for this cheiii😭😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for serah.

Please mums with daughters teach them to know that they are enough so that they can't stomach such BS.
To know that you can leave the table when love is not being served anymore, because clearly if. Person chooses a second person it means they love the second person,if they truly loved the first person they wouldn't have eyed the second.
We shouldn't glorify immorality because this is clearly IMMORALITY!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen that is not your marriage . Period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There  are a lot of lessons here in this  young family.  It is unique and real. Most  people are fake that is  why the are throwing  their ins
q4sWUJxjc4g,Insecurities. Remain focused Abu. Family  Serah your Strength is calmness. + Maureen.  Respect. +Abu. Positivity. Things have happened naturally but be intentional about managing your unique gifts.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s not for me…but this family seems happy and the kids see their parents working..so good luck guys….
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine such nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, you asked, Cerah are you Happy?  She answered ""  Yes, I'm comfortable.  Thats not the same."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I noted that
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sad aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,Heartbreaking.... wouldn't wish whatever Cerah is experiencing to anyone
q4sWUJxjc4g,I didn't get to that part. Lynn's interviews bring tears to my eyes. This one  made my heart ache and I couldn't finish it. Praying for Cerah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God heal Cera's heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,"During their conclusion, this man should have given Cerah special thanks for making the process easy for them. He needs to realize that his wife married him hoping their marriage covenant was going to remain as one husband one wife. He broke this covent the moment he went out to impregnate another woman. I do sense that this man was adamant about not letting Maureen go due to monetary gains. She is an entrepreneur and he wants to maximize the ladies potential to build an empire. To bad for not remembering where your first wife brought you from. Even with her alone you would have made it Jamani!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, it’s all about money. He said in the interview with Kagoni, that his business/financial success is because of Maureen. If she wasn’t as successful in business, would he have married her? I don’t think so. Love is not as blind as we think."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Na huyu second wife vile ako na sura mbaya. Cera ni mrembo. But the three are stupid. Cera for keeping up with this bullshit, the man for keeping the two wives in the same house, and Maureen for opening her stupid ugly legs to a married man and following him to his house (she had a stupid mouth to say no, I respect myself)."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why does this Maureen say she used to feel guilty? When she got involved with a married man and had unprotected sex, what did she expect?? Shameless 🚮🚮.. Glorifying nonsense here!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Someone's daughter was so stupid enough to follow a man to another woman's house. You can't even rent your bedsitter somewhere. I know the man is stupid, but both women are also STUPID. Yes. Stupid for not leaving when a man disrespects you openly by saying he is bringing another wife to your house. Stupid for keeping two wives in the same house. And stupid for opening your f***king legs to a married man and taking your clothes to another woman's house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can’t finish this one.. pure selfishness…
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Body language says alot.. Serah is not happy 😭😭😭 this nigga is selfish asf 😖😖😖 jeez, I hope Serah finds happiness again!!! She deserves better than this whole disrespect that's masked as love!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The guy got big balls how did he pull this off, he must be having alot of money"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"REMEMBER THE STORY OF SARAH AND ABRAHAM OF THE BIBLE. 
SARAH WELCOMED HAGGAI AND FINALLY SHE IS THE ONE WHO CHASED HER TOGETHER WITH THE CHILD ISHMAEL  !!!
YOU ARE ALL ENTANGLED TO THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS A SIN  !  A CHILD IS INVOLVED,  AND THEY ARE ALL THERE BECAUSE OF KIDS. 
I AM ALSO SARAH AND MY HUSBAND IS  ALSO ABRAHAM,  I  ONCE ENTERTAINED HAGGAI MY HUSBAND CONCUBINE BUT AFTER SOME TIME,  THE JEALOUSY WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE....... WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE WITH HER. 
SO I KNOW SARAH ( NAMESAKE ) YOU ARE JUST DESPERATELY THERE DEFENDING YOUR LOVE,  YOUR MARRIAGE BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY  !!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support immorality despite I being a single mum.......but mbona watu wanaona serah so pure? despite her being the 1st wife....nobody knows why Abraham decided to have a second wife...... polygamous family are all over the difference is hawa wako kwa social media......to me I can't be married a second wife and if possible I would never date a married man.......let them be aki.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Living the same house how???Sisemi kitu 
They know better.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"NO MAM!!!!  NO MAM!!!!!  He cheated and had a baby, then gave his first wife a choice, either except my sidechick and my baby or go.  This was not a situation of wanting a second wife where He discussed taking a second wife and Cerah agreed to it.  He cheated, got caught, confessed and told her I'm not leaving my sidechick so you have to except this and She did!!!!.  Thats betrayal .....  No judgement but NOPE!!!!!   Lynn would not allow him to beat around the bush either, you are such a great interviewer."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So so disturbing, I am cringing as I watch.  Understanding your self worth is important and choosing yourself even when all choose not to is very crucial !!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The more I listen to this man I get a sense of a man who unfortunately is very selfish and not smart......... even Maureeen surely why why do this to a fellow woman?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wanawake let's style up,suit ya mwenyewe achana nayo,acha kuweka kiraka yet u know he has the owner.abraham Serah ndo bibi wa ujana wako,hao wengine u're wasting your time and energy,nimeenda I can't watch more this is stupid"
q4sWUJxjc4g,These kind of men are just difficult to handle (Maureen -he is not easy) am sure serah alishangaa huyu msichana anawezana na Abraham ..she agreed to it for her to grow and get something for herself Maureen apambane na Abraham hiyo maneno ingine.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, this interview, what impact does it have? How does it inspire? 
We are glorifying infidelity, both women are loosers"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is a lucky man. He has two very very mature ladies!!! Be a gentleman, be a family man, and take your position in the lives of your wives and children. This union is no longer a secret, it's in the public domain so PLEASE, PLEASE, make it more beautiful than what we've already seen. There will be hills to climb and valleys to descend but you're THREE MATURE PEOPLE, deal with your everything beautifully. Put God first, and DON'T allow the devil to find his way in. Abraham, DON'T COURT #3."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sijui mbona hii wimbo ya rose muhando ya  baba nipee uvimilivuuu inaniimbia kwa kichwa🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,All of them should go for deliverance and stop all these nonsense . PERIOD.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hope Maureen is genuine 🙏, Serah all the best, I know how hard betrayal is 😪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Growing up in a polygamous family should be defined as a form of trauma.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Years down the lane - kids will notice the little things - whether you know it or not, you are treating them differently- you just said it has to be beyond love =bias, this should not be seen as a good thing.

This guy seems proud of himself for making this marriage work though the premise of this arrangement was just selfishness and lies. I truly hope that they have peace and are truly happy not just putting on a facade for social media. Nothing about his choices is worth emulating.

I wish God can be coming in to delete love same way He wrote it in our hearts. 🙏🏼 
Just my views. Peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah loves her husband  too much to carry his baggage  . Abraham  give men hint on how to deal with their  mess and man up . Great for taking your responsibility. In  marriage  you wake in new  things everyday. Its parties involved  choice to put up or go.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My analysis
Abraham is a narcissist, he is so full of himself n only cares about his selfish gains.....he doesn't truly love either of the women, it's obvious Cerah is nothing to him than a baby mama  a burden who doesn't match up to him n am sure he regrets marrying her. And Maureen is this bright, intelligent beautiful woman who is  always ahead of the game playing a very great role to help him meet his vision n dream of becoming this renounced rich tycoon (it's only about money)..and this makes it look like he loves Maureen, that's why he have his heart in her, the way he looks at her, talks about her....he knows that she is his lucky star in making it in life, so he has to show her love appreciation and attention to keep her locked in his world that's why he says he looks beyond love. That's a real narcissist!!!! We can't sugar coat it anyhow
It's obvious Cerah will remain a wounded soul in this whole arrangement  coz Abraham feels she doesn't add any value to his life. The earlier she will leave that stupid marriage the better coz she is most likely to lose herself In all this pretence. I just wish we as Kenyans can support this woman Cerah so that she can become independent n know her value....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True. Narcissism at its peak
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Atleast someone called it out..This Narcissistic personality full of himself and lack sense of empathy..Who on earth would do that? He is praying reverse psychology on these two ladies and destroying the two ladies to the chore.Neither of them is lucky, give it time.."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn  you went full blown with questions.  I was holding my gut as Abraham was answering. Good job Lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men tend to be so selfish, what if she had done that to him. I also feel for Sarah, polygamy is not my cup of tea. I'd rather leave. I pray for grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is very controlling..Cera wake up..
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact Abraham has accepted his responsibilities and respects his wives equally..i pray he remains balanced till death do them part..Their children will be proud of him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wewe God cannot bless something He didn't ordain. 
God changes no.
You don't know Who God is? 
His commandment says, thou shalt not covet your neighbors properties even their spouses. 
People stealing other people's things is part of the new world order, new liberal order where the commandments of God are made null and void."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have seen a man of 75 years with his two wives and no their children are NOT proud of the situation but he is the ladies are not happy either but to please him ? They ALL pretend there are no cracks
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati proud????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaaah it's so hard to comment about them.who are we to judge, only God in heaven knows everything."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When you listen keenly there is a place the man says this one is just a good woman ( Sara) and the other ones is good and focused.....in short the second was hardworking,was bringing him cash so he kinda liked her for that....Sara had no choice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hate it when adults drag their children into their foolishness.My mother pretended to be accepting and understanding like Sera but we were traumatised as kids,down the road there was alot of clashing in the house,our friends made fun of us,our understanding of marriage was affected,we were literally dragged into a situation that we didn't sign up for.Down the road mom goes into a depression, we were kicked out and she died regretting why she had allowed her daughters into this Compromising situation.Alot of this talk is about the adults but what of the psychological effects the children have to go through??
It doesn't matter how these people want to spin it,they are not wiser than God who intended Marriage to be a sacred convenant between two people and 3 is a crowd.It may seem to work for sometime but anything born out of lies and pain will end the same way.A seed will always reproduce after its own kind and you may try to convince the world it is working but from experience it ends with alot of pain and resentment.
I hope these women can do right by the children and show their daughters you don't need to be defined by this foolishness!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry for what you & your mother endured!! So true. It really affects children. A second wife not matter how understanding “poisons the well”…it’s a huge NO!

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am just wondering if me being me I am feeling pains listening to this story and ain't even close or in this family..How is this so comfortable with them.? Someone might be bearing so much pain and doubt in this relationship.. and is silent.Truth to be told Abraham is in love with Maureen but respects Cerah.. and Cerah seems so comfortable with pity party vibe that Maureen and Abraham are giving her..
Dear ladies let's understand what's love is... Let's understand the effort and package that true love comes with... Indeed I concur with the Verse that says my people perish for lack of wisdom"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the aspect of Bible man was made to be for one ☝️ wife,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel like Abraham clicked with Maureen they have a connection so strong from the look of things,  however Sera is more of the submissive, reserved type that does all wifely duties. I don't know if I could tolerate this if I was in Sera's shoes. I'm speechless tho."
q4sWUJxjc4g,To Mr husband; you got yourself a set of VERY smart women.  You may be “the man of the house” on paper but know these ladies are in charge!  Don’t change anything because you will loose BIG time!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaaaaaaaaha😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is a betrayer gosh,i feel for Serah she looks like she's suffering inside and love is lost here. This man aaaai hapana no lady should undergo such it's beyond betrayal. I hope Serah finds some bold decision on her peace of mind. His face looks slapable but what ever he is doing is wrong but I wish them well."
q4sWUJxjc4g,SERA am sorry my dear sister hii mchezo made me device my husband and am now happily interpended with my son.... been interpended is something have been  happy about....I don't think I will marry coz am happy been single
q4sWUJxjc4g,35:26-Lynn is a psychologist you got her there...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let me be the devil's advocate on this one,those saying serah had no choice she actually did,as they said Abraham is capable and willing to take care of his kids irregardless,and when he told her for the first time he was clear and told her she could leave if chose to,so don't say she had no choice.. Stop judging them as a bitter wife who was left like don't be personal about it and maybe you could get it???? It's 2022 throuple couples are a thing,you don't know their relationship beyond this or how they relate so stop feeling sorry for someone who had a choice of leaving..Ata labda the chics are bisexual na sisi Tuko Hapa tunalia tu,let people do what makes them happy nobody died and named you Jesus's next of kin..When I made the first comment I hadn't watched it all,hapa Cera is still in pain and the guy loves the second wife more,and Cerah is in love with Abraham more."

Genesis 2:24: Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The level of fuckery.....this guy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah I don’t know you but May God fight for you. We can understand you couldn’t leave what you had built,Those people who call right wrong and wrong right it’s sad. Isaiah 34:16 talks abt mate not mates. This second lady should find her mate. This is not her mate whether she gets kids every yr."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First things first...this man is selfish! Throughout the interview he says ""me, me, me!"" Its not about ""us"" or ""them"". It's Abraham this...Abraham that!
Fact- you had an affair! You then went ahead and impregnated Maureen. You put her in position where she is locked down and stuck with you for life - hence selfish!
2nd, you put your wife in the worst position anyone could ever ask for. You knew whatever you were doing was wrong,thats why you were not honest with her. This woman made your house a home and you plainly disrespected her and your children. At no point did you ever think what this would do to her. Your main concern was loosing them both. You clearly state that you didn't want to loose Sarah*(not sure of spelling), because loosing her meant loosing your 1st home. Even when she found out about Maureen, your first reaction was being defensive not apologizing to her-hence selfish! Adding insults to injury, you lured her with that B.S of she aint loosing you and all the benefits that come from you being her ""husband"", to convince her that she is still the ""main squeeze!""
3rd, you have children both of you. What are you going to tell your children? How do you explain this? So you will both face your kids and tell them,"" this is how marriage should be?"" That it's okay to love 2 men / women? Is that what you really want your children to grow up idolizing? When will some parents understand that when you get married, you are not just seeking a spouse? That man/ woman will be the father/ mother of your children? You both as parents are starting a whole generation with a messed up mindset like this.
4th, if you guys have any form of relationship with God, you know he will never bless this marriage? He meant marriage to be for one man and one woman! Yes you can have more than one soulmate,but you get to be with them when your current soulmate has gone to heaven. Can we please stop normalizing polygamy and trying to make it look cute!?
5th- Abraham,when Lynn asked you if you can love more than 2 people at the same time,your respose was,""it has to be more than love."" OKAY! If today Sarah comes home with another man and tells you the same B.S, will you create room in your house for the other man? Coz certainly, it has to be more than love right? * ponder on that!* Maureen,if tables were turned,would you have opened your door for Sarah as she did  with you? Oh! Best one yet, when Mr Abraham crosses the street and spots another woman,will ya'll create space for the other woman too?
These ladies have been emotionally manipulated to the point that they had to find a way to cope with each other. Tears are been held back, how these ladies speak, anyone who is REALLY listening can hear the pain behind the giggles 
Well...Lynn thank you for peeling this onion and asking the right questions as usual. Anyway,it's their circus and their monkeys!"

I hope my daughters will always feel enough and will be empowered enough to walk away from situations like this. 
My heart goes out to Cerah, I feel like if she was empowered enough, she wouldn't have to settle in this situation. I pray she gets to a point where she will spread her wings and see how much of an amazing woman she is. 
I bet if places were traded and Maureen was the first wife she wouldn't have accepted to have a co wife.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing glamorous about this arrangement men seeing themselves superior than women and women who are desperate to have husbands. Single parenthood is better than this. 

Lynn you are respected for the work and contents you bring to us and I hope airing this on your channel will make Ceera get some professional help since she is hurting. A man who does not recognise that he hurt his wife is a toxic man and the trust is gone. Love is built on trust and when that is gone you are left with nothing. 

I feel for the children of this union, why are we so selfish that nobody talks about those children growing up in such an environment. When they attend school they learn other children have one mum and one dad, while yours have to discuss about their two mums.

Parents please talk to your young girls about loving themselves and not to be taken for granted by men. Lynn please get us grown up people who grew up in such arrangements we learn from them. This is so depressing. Sorry I had to rant and I am a mother of an adult girl and what I taught my daughter she could never settle for such."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Infidelity  at it's  highest.
Immorality  of the highest order between   Maureen and  this man.
Pole Serah.Soldier on.You are the wife that is recognised  by God.One wife one man.Hiyo ingine  ni  umalaya."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He took charge of his responsibilities and so the women just followed .
He did not change his treatment  to his wife because  of maureen,this is where most men go wrong .
Kuaanza matharau kwa nyumba juu they have someone out there ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad ever I watched... wasting my time. Watching this.. very bad indeed ..... cwezi mak
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kwa raha zao though as Christians is not good but who are we.
q4sWUJxjc4g,When Serah said she has never been lucky on anything in her life apart from the husband..I really felt it. She's trying to hold onto that one thing that she believes is lucky to have hence can persevere through anything to have it. Tough times
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah its not late' Just like your name God is gonna bless you soo much for loving Abrahan unconditionally inspite of your impeccable beauty..you have such a biiig heart.. I dont have the guts to marry a married man it doesn't matter how rich , good looking or how he makes me feel.. My nature of thinking about others first wouldnt let me boldily crush another womans heart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"....and to think the affair begun right after they moved in together, she feels too betrayed. Wondering why the only thing was good to her, she wasn't enough for it💔💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@treasureforashes3497 same here, when I was single, and a married man would hit on me, I would completely cut links with them the moment I realised they were married because I honor marriages, and I would not like to do to another woman, what I would not want to be done to me. A married man is a no go zone. Period!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I felt  for cerah. that's why she hold on not to lose what she believes  is lucky to her. hopefully one day cerah will  have her family back. maureen pray to God to bless you with your own husband. it's not  fair to  cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think it's because she has 3 kids and she feels no man can  vibe her. Oh God of miracles...remember Cera. She is stubbed, she bleeds inside. I hear Abraham has a pure heart....hmmm, it's only God with a pure heart dear. Abraham even afforded to wander and love another woman...where is the pure heart then???? Such a beautiful woman, unable to help herself because at the back of her mind, she thinks about her 3 children."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah and Mureen have gold heart. Cerah forgiveness of her husband weakness helped Mureen to forgive herself. Husband you are been helped by this woman. Always value and apologize for the mistake. Abraham work on yourself please so as to enjoy old age. God bless this family and keep the children in love. Peace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham ni fisi ata chukuwa piya tu mwingine wa tatu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its sad really, no wife wants to share her husband with another woman. Cerah didn't have the strength to leave after the husband told her he was in love with the side chick and wasn't going to leave her. This man knew he wanted more than one wife that is why he didn't mary Cerah legally. I don't trust that this man is not  gonna go for third and fourth wife"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is crazy in all aspects but to each it’s own. The man is the beneficiary in this mess fulfilling his ego. Raising children in this environment and thinking it is right for selfish reasons. This man will take off soon watch. His 👁 are probably wandering already. I have heard similar stories and witnessed where the women collectively accepted and trusted the man he brought an STD and killed all of them. Several stories out there like that. Mother’s please raise your daughter’s to love and respect themselves and to be dependent on their own to avoid such nonsense in the future.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The two women blend,the guy is lucky, Mali zote ni safi, roho zao zimeweza,the guy seems to b doing well to maintain the two,guess the Ladies play a big role too..it will reach a point the ladies will sexually do their thing even witht the husbnd..better than going out"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How many of us can accept co-wife .sera don’t demean yourself you ain’t happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Surely mauriene u said truth. Serah u r wao leave the negative comments alone,aki I loved more than b4. N to u Abraham u r gold! Big up bro u really 💪❤️👌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Allow me to say Abraham ni kadinya wa kawaida....and this other chic is a typical husband snatcher. Ni vile tu walipata cerah can stomach bullshit...no sorry
q4sWUJxjc4g,They look like identical twins.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't advocate for anything here God created one man one wife. It's painful how we try to create short term happiness. Deep down the first wife knows shez betrayed, the second one is full of guilt that might not be in full effect now but slowly but surely it will hit her. Lyn thanks for the questions aki hii Dunia imenichokesha mimi Sasa kama tumefikia hapa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just don't like the way serah found about the affair..Men please come out clean on time..All in all this is a case of eating your cake and having it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a very smart guy because in most cases if he doesn’t satisfy both of them his life might be at stake. cerah is the smartest woman ever because she decided not to leave her house for another woman and Maurine knows very well she didn’t do the right thing but her humbleness is worth being protected... Abraham’s keep on I love how you advocate for love peace and respect.. Every man is a polygamist..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn congrats on the thorough interview. Abraham seems like someone who lives for himself. He is from a very humble begging with a green court. That time he could not talk to serah until he was better.Mourine hakua mpango was kando,alikua ni biz.(kutafuta pesa).Hiyo kuhamisha hao sio juu ya watoto ni kurahihisha life yake.Thanks . Watch this space when he eventually gets stable .......Unless aokoke ama abadirishe altitude.......wulululuuu. l have been there hata kuenda nje ndiyo itazidi kaa hajaanza."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you have to make a hard decision like choosing between two people, choose the second one because if you really loved the first one you wouldn't have entertained the second one in the first instance."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a circus
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even without going to the comments , I knew directly Serah is not happy because the smile and eyes can tell! This’s rubbish, and this so called man will still get another mpango to top it up!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love this family be blessed 💗😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I know this might be challenging since many have a different perspective on how marriage should be,but let's not be hypocrites this man could have had Maureen aside and still be having his wise cerah and then back and forth arguments that could have spoiled their home,some women are actually understanding and genuine with their love,we all know if you love someone and really been him for long you don't wanna loose him more so if he has been a good dad and husband,how many men have kids somewhere and still cheat etc,if only our hearts were genuine and peaceful we would all tell our selves that sometimes love is different and changes,to me i see normal genuine people who love this man and have despite all learned to appreciate each other and move forward,just like any other marriage some challenges might come in but let's not pressure them and add in things that will make one feel disappointed or less loved cause that's where problems arise(competition),I pray that their hearts are genuine towards each other and that this man won't repeat this and learn to be content with this family, blessings Lynn for this show"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have been avoiding to listen to this story but l wanted to know whats up. Serah🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyne aki hii story imenibamba mm I am first wife but my co wife anaroho mbaya sana pliz nikikuja kenya lazima nitakutafuta
q4sWUJxjc4g,Haki I shed tears with Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,BS 2 seconds in and I am out upuzi!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn your shows are usually insightful. What are we learning from this sad and controversial show? This man claims he is christian but openly disregards the commandments of God. Which church advocates for this madness? Why has the church failed to rebuke sin? Is it because of the offerings they bring that priests/pastors cant tell them the truth? 

Let us not hide in this ...' dont judge phrase'. Let  us be truthful and the truth will set us free. This is surely adultery disguised as 'a happy polygamous marriage?' Polygamy has and will always be chaotic.  Let us not glorify sexual sin by making this wrong act famous.Cerah is not happy AT ALL. I am confused about what morals we have to learn from this. Where are we heading with this? 

Should we, our daughters, sisters be immoral and sleep with people's husbands and become second wives?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is moody because  of her menopause 😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why am I so imotional 😭😭whn sara talks... I love you baby girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,They should wait for third wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Njengewa kwako uondokee wacera itakua poa ukiwa na hao yako were Moreen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't look happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sara ,congratulations  you made this family so successful, if it were not you, the joy they have they couldn't get. Your husband and  the wife should  thank you. All credit go to Sara."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pure Adultery,no success hear."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham doesn't love Sara and she knows it. I wish she'd just move out
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad story I must say. Show me a young girl who wants to be in a polygamous marriage. None. Breaks my heart.💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Team Lynn icant get enough of watching this show the polygamy is not bad when you believe in God respect committed and love better polygamy kuriko marriage singine akubariki God bless you Abraham and your 2wife and children 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy has life long effects...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"First answer me is the man luo?okay I have heard that wives who marrry Luos always know that as a must a man must take a second wife .then secondly me I won’t judge coz I see moslems with four wives , then I also see men cheating at most everyday some even cheat on us with our friends so I think if they made it a decision it’s their choice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The devil is lair God created one rib from a man not two ribs
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki this is so amazing 😍😍 wow congratulations to father Abraham 😍🥰 and I know it's not easy to make such kind of a decision but I personally I respect that decision and to see them happy and enjoying it,may God bless this family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Desparation
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham would you be ok if this happens to your daughters.
Cerah would you want your daughter to eat from the same plate you are eating from.
Maureen,How would you feel if your daughter's husband got another woman in the same roof with her.?
Question of the day"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me I can’t share my husband even if he decides to marry Angel Gabriel as a second wife I can’t share him with any living being what don’t I have that he saw in another woman? God forbid I can’t.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Heart breaking. Serah...serah...gorgeous,listen  mami,leave this dude.
Leave them to it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy doesnt give Serah time to answer questions and express herself. Hes always interfering as she talks
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man aaaaaa🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮 . Serah please love yourself honey .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham has pride and anakaa kiongo kiumu biu nderikaga kana gukarario. Serah is a darling. Maureen maswali ni mingi mda ni mchache wueh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is sad state of affair.... Cerah seems to have no choice about her husband decision.... I blame Moureen to playing Okey in putting asunder Cera's marriage knowingly. She had the power to safeguard Cera's family if she cared and was genuine. She allowed herself to be part of the ""team"" for gains. God will strongly judge Abraham and Moureen...... I also believe there is a reason the union was blessed with a girl. What goes around comes back around... Tujiangalie"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The only thing I can say is that Cera is so beautiful ❤️.Hiyo ingine ni usherati. Plus money is the keeping this whole shenanigans 😜.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love those couples me itake it  positive there is no need of fight,marriage is committed respect and understand each ,Abraham  your very wise man and you love your 2 wife God bless your family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Unajifanya na umeenda kuharibu Sara's marriage...Sera please open up ur eyes
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera achia hii nugu his kids n step ..kwani ni kesho...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mourine you're a pretender please stop pretending please...ingekuwa wewe haungekubali Sera to be ur Co wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can’t continue watching a fellow woman being disrespected like this, l have to stop watching this. I am struggling to understand why a man who has a beautiful wife like Cera would go out with a woman who is nothing in comparison to his wife. Cera is very beautiful and polite. She appears sad and overwhelmed. Cera seems to be struggling to laugh. Keep praying Cera, the devil is a liar, this is your husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a proud polygamous father i provide for my family whom i love.
           By this video's comment section I can atest that this platform is for and by women especially kikuyu bitter women to tell you the truth our grandfather's had more than 2 wives.Islam the only true religion remaining advocates for this.Mwanaume akitafuta pesa yake na anataka kukula na mabibi wake whats evil about that.(esp with this economy).Kunao wameolewa na bwana moja na ni vita tupu and God knows magonjwa zenye wanapewa.Having multiple wives is not easy.
    Human beings have been civilized for about 10,000 years and Man has always  been polygamous untill about 150 years ago that this agenda of feminism and demonising masculinity.
      Ask any man this if you were to have as many wives as you want but they will peacefully and loyal would you want that  hakuna mwanaume ata kataa.
      Its not evil to be polygamous and any woman in a polygamous set up if you are provided for,felt appreciated loved and cared for know your man loves you and you are not belittled."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera and Maureen don't let him bring another woman in the same style of story coz he might be broken in this style.. wishing you well. You can do much together the Three of you. So live well your decision..
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know if it's Maureen pretending to care for Cera or Abraham not being in love with Cerah buh something is definitely off. Hugs Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine despite serah being a first wife ...apa anakaa third wheeler wallai
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,i wanted to say that... I think the level of so called respect maureen has is coming from the fact that she knows for  fact that she is defintly the love of abrahams life.Sera only has the position of i was here first which is not very strong.Maureen knowws she is deeeply loved so its easy to play nice.She doesnt feel at all threatened by sera.Abraham is with sera because she refuses to leave....I feel there should have been another interview asking real questions.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True man, we are happy for you man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu ni fisi tuu.taking advantage coz ako loaded!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This marriage is a lie it will end in tears,serah is naive she's still hurting."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Same house,I can't 😒😒😒niwe mboch yenu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We are not people out there  respect  the audience father abraham. Maureen is DEATH. Period! What God has put together let no man or woman put asunder. Sarah simply  has no choice but to accept this destroyer Maureen. No need to justify immorality.  Abraham you wronged cera, you are a  bad example to ur kids, what are u teaching them, that a man can have 2wives, would  you  be okay if ur daughter was put thru what ur putting cera  through"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometimes it's good to be a firm no nonsense woman.  Ujinga inafanyiwa mbali
q4sWUJxjc4g,But maureen anakaa mzee kuliko Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is an adult and I believe that her decision to still remain in the marriage even after the introduction of Maureen was a sane one.People out here will just be bitter that she made a decision that don't sit well with them but remember its her life and is entitled to making such decisions.As long a she is truly happy and so is everyone else in this family then they are good to go.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She did not have a choice
q4sWUJxjc4g,I strolled through the comments and the Evil is a lie.  These commenters from Hell are so Jealous cause the devil is their their Dad (Father).  Their are throwing the First Stone.
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are bringing their story out to gain followers my foot
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thanks Lynn is very good interview you held.. sera you have a good hearts even though is still painful. Maureen you founded yourself where you never imagined. Abraham.. please..it might seem so nice for you but you need to say enough! Coz you will meet other women with much gift even than the  two ..so we don't expect to bring the third.  Abraham you have two women in the house..know that they are stronger than you.sera and Maureen stay s close without jealous and you shall be well, for there are no coincidence in life.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He want to eat his cake and have it. Can he take it.....if you flip the coin.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki Sarah beutifull inside and out.blessed woman.God will bless u dear soon
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is heartless, I am really so much hurt about the betrayal I am Not even Kenyan and I beg leave God outside your lust. You are Not a Christian the Bible isn't requesting us to have two spouse let alone the one you cheated with..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You had a kid before telling your wife. People are wicked.
q4sWUJxjc4g,What’s wrong with women? How many men can share one woman. Please women love yourselves. I’m sorry I’m not watching this. Thank you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Better them they know that wko wawil kwa nyumba than nyinyi mnajifanya mko innocent na hizo comments zenu na mnajua mko maside chicks mnaangusha mboma za wenyewe na mko ma single mothers kwedeni huko 🗑
q4sWUJxjc4g,Better Tingiza mtii and  sneak hii  knowledge-based ya nonsense 😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen she's there to know Sarah's weakness so that in long run she may be able to attack Sarah. Atumia eri ni nyugu ya urogi. It's a say in kikuyu. Sarah open your eyes. There is no love kila mtu ajikalishe na maisha yake.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is full of God's wisdom. This is not easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki ni mzuri
q4sWUJxjc4g,He will still get a third one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why am I watching this interview at such a time of the night? The hardest interview ever... How can one justify this level of broad day betrayal??? More grace upon you Lynn 😥😥😥 this story is getting sadder...there's nothing like a second wife, you're a strange woman.God have mercy on us."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also wanted to stop halfway..
Maureen is also struggling to fit"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I lack words,its sooo painful justifying and sungarcoating infidelity.serah i feel f you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes I hope God gives Sera sufficient grace because she doesn’t seem happy this looks like a joke.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ndoa ni ya wawili huyu wa tatu ni wakujiongezae ..sara anaumia Mungu asaidie Sara...she is hurting ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You and Judy AUSTIN are sisters..
 EEEE Eeeee So, you are Advising All Sidekicks to be Upgraded??? You are asking Sidekicks to go After the married men they are sleeping around with. Keep your Dirty Advice to yourself. I wish you were the first wife and Sarah had to come after you. The way, I see you? You would have created a situation and also never had Sarah put her Feet in your House. A married man is the best thing that could have happened to you? How desperate????"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't support polygamy but the way these men out here cheat I would rather be knowing that we are two wives than the man be sleeping around with random women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm sorry but these triple has convinced themselves that they are okay. For the husband to sleep with another woman, get her pregnant, and have a child together is plain disrespect for his wife. He didn't even have the balls to tell her until she went through his phone. Sarah/Cera got hurt and betrayed, I don't think she's in a better place. Maureen is just in love and her conscience will always eat her up!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Financial stability today will make you be on top of the food chain....ladies work hard
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, it's clear as Day!!! You have taken all the love from.this woman. She now looks like a convenience and you at least you have father abraham at work to keep increasing your love and on top of that Maureen you deserve to go away from Social Medial because you are a sidekick upgraded to a second wife. Sarah, there are single mothers out there doing great! You dont have to be between these two fools. He got what he always wanted Maureen because of her brain and her fair skin. I feel for Sarah, any psychologist will tell you that she needs Therapy... As for father Abraham Maureen is the kind of woman he always wanted. Sarah, is very calm and submissive but suffers inside."
q4sWUJxjc4g,First wife is always cheated when it gets to such things.  Abraham will get more wives. He choose moreen knowing very well he had Sara.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah soo much truth is coming out for you in this interviews that pain is plastered on your face.you able to see more if you care.Hope God can heal your heart.Maureen  Maureen home breakers have all excuses,but karma is real."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen that was bad.Lets not sugar-coated Father Abraham.He will soon Marry a Mzungu coz it's kinda he fall in love with the whiter woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is younger than uyu 2nd wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Those people busy saying Cera she is bitter u the ones bitter that actualy she can put selfishness away and decide let us be....i admire u Cera a lot and Maureen for the respect u have shown is high level
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't see any problem if they are happy, who are we to judge them....  All the best guys."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense... Sarah was desperate she didn't have option...wanawake tutafute pesa
q4sWUJxjc4g,When i saw the kid......the pain never heals......no amount of explanation can heal the pain...why am  I crying
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This felt so wrong and uncomfortable to watch 
There’s nothing to be proud of here.
Notice how he keeps saying Sarah instead of serah even when she clearly stated that she doesn’t like to be called Sarah. He doesn’t pay attention to her.
Serah needs to leave!
But what do I know at my age🥹"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The first marriage didn't start from a place of love but from a place of convenience. The way he says he woke up to her doing household chores, so to him it was a practical decision. Jamani."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was looking for this comment... this is what happens when women play wife to be “picked”... pickmeshas
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly. He loves the second woman. I pray Cerah gets the strength to leave. Its never too late
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly...first marriage started out of convenience.Not love
q4sWUJxjc4g,You make alot of sense... The first marriage was for convenience
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nkt!! This guy really has guts 😳
Am I the only one who's struck by his response when Cerah asked him who Maureen is 🙄🙄 somewhere minute 43 of the interview....yani at cerah's lowest moment the guy chose to admit how much he loves this Maureen in question and how he wasn't leaving her for anything 🤔
That was a mean response depending on the state the wife was at the very moment....Maureen appears to be a nice lady but there's something wrong with her coz 2nd wife is a naaaaaah......nowadays women seem to have lost their dignity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I’ll kill somebody’s son oohh😳
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can see ata mwanamme is still guilty,he betrayed Sera n it's still haunting him ata kumuangalia Kwa macho anajichuku"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is a good person
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am feeling something deep down my heart...but anyways can't say much...hugs Serah 🥺❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Khai the Audacity..""I have a child with Maureen and i love her and iam not stopping and i have no intention of chasing you"" Khaaaaaaaaii Jesus is Lawd..its getting emoshonoooo...Serah ni 3rd wheel..using the child as the scapegoat 😩😩"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is more sexy than moureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Respect to the first wife only few can do that
q4sWUJxjc4g,Respect to the first wife only few can do that
q4sWUJxjc4g,deep down Serah is not happy. she dint have a choice.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don’t know if I should feel sorry for Sera, Abraham gave her an ultimatum when she found out about his affair with Maureen, yet she made a decision to stay in a polygamous relationship. 

You are so beautiful & intelligent,why subject yourself to this nonsense.

Maureen couldn’t you find your own man? Shameless."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The energy it takes to keep stating ""am not a home destroyer""🤦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is a smart woman and no matter what she went through to accept maureen in this,yeye aliona future ya watoi wake so hagekuwa na choice.she had to fight for her kids life juu ageleta wana agerushwa inje na maureen agetook over and life bado igesonga.better ivo ali accept ata ka sio easy .big up serah.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,😭😭hugs from me Cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abra you should get another home for moureen to maintain that respect btwn the two since this respect they have can't last forever if they continue staying in the same house
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu Maureen huyu ungenipata mimi ningekusho vile kunaendanga count yourself lucky u met a calm woman like serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't believe in polygamy..for me is a big no no le me share a without me knowing.. this is total bullshit
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The three are just amazing people, no human is perfect but they have found a way of dealing with their imperfections in a very sweet and amazing way😍... I love you guys and may God take you all through everything."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mwangi you stayed with Serah out of pitty
q4sWUJxjc4g,What  a  lucky man
q4sWUJxjc4g,But Maureen achana na bwana ya wenyewe I feel bad
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have watched a lot of weired stories but this one was at the top. Do a follow up this…. And by the way, the same way we want to do conversations about men having 2 wifes, the should now be prepared for women having 2 men…. The world is done…."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"His body language (at the beginning of the video) clearly shows he loves the 2nd wife more. Look at how he's holding her gaze and the attention he's giving her, while to Cera it's just a glance. So sad!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think mourine it’s unfair can you plz just look for another home with ur kid and leave sera and her husband plz ….just do cooperating with tat Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer!
q4sWUJxjc4g,it's his guts for me....haaa... women take too much nonsense.No matter the  money he has I don't think any Nigerian woman would take this. God forbid.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me give my thoughts. Nowadays most of us do what satisfy our ego God and His laws aside.As long as we satisfy our fresh and are happy we don't care what bible says......what will give fame and win majority is priority. I feel for serah and just pray this moreen finds her own man repent and leave serahs hubby.Period!.You and the man you know what you have done to serah.I pray God will open your eyes and repent.Dont force serah  to justify yourselfiness.Period! Maureen run  🏃‍♂️ for your life b4 its too late.Leave them peacefully.!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love got lost at some point. He is keeping cerah for reputation. Cerah is tied up n hurt. Maureen is guilty n clearly got in knowingly
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Staying alone indeed is an option we sometimes overlook as women. I wouldn't have taken this, the guy wasn't even apologetic. I feel he was heartless especially how he broke the news to Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I ove serah for free

q4sWUJxjc4g,"So Imagine when Serah had a child, obviously there were needs she couldn't fulfil ..so anapmbana na baby na mzee akiwa na Maureen...This is hard big"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish Maureen never came to this family
q4sWUJxjc4g,if udaku was a person.....Lynn u win
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah loved this man so much to let him go, Sarah doesn't seem happy I feel like she had no option, again why are they staying in the same house,SMH , I will make sure I empower my daughter..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well Well, i feel like commenting today, if you listen very Well, the day he got confronted about maureen,, he defended himself with , he loves Maureen and she is not going anywhere and if cerah wanted to go, she can go and leave the kids. I feel like he loves maureen and cerah is just there because of the kids.. cerah’s  parting shot was so sweet."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Bible gives one the right to leave after infidelity. But Cerah has decided to stay. May God give you strength but you will soon transition.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some math ain't mathing...so they moved in with Serah in 2012 and in the same year he started dating Maureen...you're sugarcoating sin...alafu  Maureen said they would just have coffee but Serah said there were times he didn't go home...ayam lost..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen looks old and a pretender.

q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love u guys n respect your choices.keep it up
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Maureen are only explaining and justifying their infidelity to sera(they are trying too much it’s sad to watch..). I hope she forgives them and forgives herself one day….light and love for Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hahaha enyewe it's a man's world. This man created his own world and they both had to fit in it. Wamama hukapitia. But if they are happy, that's all that matters. Hii life haina formula"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God is not a God of confusion, if you are a young lady and want to get married pray about it, fast, and wait on the Lord to give you your one and only husband, please do not enter and entangle yourself where there is a relationship already, young man looking do the same and do maintain whoever you choose as yours only, just be contented, remember the word in Proverbs 16:25 There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end, it leads to death. Humans lets choose to do what pleases God=Obedience"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is true, do not judge them, it already happened, but, it's up to young people to learn from this story and then choose right, you cannot do it alone but with God."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When they hug each other, aki nimetoa machozi kama mwanaume! Aki sometimes maisha haikuwagi poa,lkn love is a much big thing on earth! Abraham congrats alot!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I come from a culture which allowed this .98 % of it  never ended well. The hell Breaks loose when the kid are older enough to figure out whats going on. Pliz father Abraham , let each wife to have her own place for the sake of your kids. And as a respekt to ur first wife."

 Ngoja Watoi Wakuwe Wakubwa!!!

q4sWUJxjc4g,Still waters run deep
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polite and soft spoken men.. Wachana nao, run for your dear life.
Those people are not genuine and manipulative."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is their way of life yes, but as a result of the spirit of lust and it is sin. Marrying a second wife implied, one lost interest in the first wife.   Besides that, In real sense, Polygamy is painful. You may pretend but there are usually some unpleasant competitions that end up ruining the whole family. I would rather women work hard, develop yourself, ukionyeshwa madharau, run for your dear life. I believe it is not right to 'make fun' of two women when a man knows too well deep down his heart that he loves one and hates the other. Abraham seems to be taking advantage of Serah's vulnerability which is somewhat unfair."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My Heart goes out to cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My love for Lynn. Good job mami🥰😍😍😍This man is so full of himself. Sad how we give this gender so much power over us. Maureen seems pretentious so much. So you call sera the first time this time for business na last time you said you called her coz your baby was sick🙄😳
Hugs to you serah❤️💖and stop lying to yourself. Hapo hakuna love kwako😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nilinote nikadhani niko solo.....uyu maureen ni muongo sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeuh!!...To each their own.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sasa how does the ladies feel Abraham akikosa kwenda kwa bed yake 😂😂😢weh this one is not for the faint hearted😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can read pain in sarahs face, acheni kujifanya bt lazima kuna uchungu kwa roho ya sarah, Acha siku sarah atapata pesa ata move on na awachie Maureen bwana"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn to Abraham: ""how about love... I still love you?"" 😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love 💕 Lynn very smart in her line of questioning
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is definitely not OK. Poor thing 😢, the fact that they're going out more publicly will make it harder for Sera to admit but I hope she finds herself sooner than later."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This polygamy manenos is very complicated.  My grandfather had 5 wives. My Dad tried and it became more like Afganistan.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah doesnt like pple calling her Sarah, but i have realised Abraham and maureen ndio wanamuita Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I salute  Serah... she is very genuine...even from the looks...serah God bless  🙌 you. I am into it for 20yrs .and we don't  see into each other's eye....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hypocrisy of the highest order...serah is being played  and until the day she will realise that I think she'll be happy.. how I wish they can live in different houses coz the are all decided to live the way they're living..siku moja and God forbid kinaeza umana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You know there's something I'm asking myself ""muratheka ruo Tari mwago"" like what's funny.  Cera may God see you through... Yaani this man was so ready to loose cera?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s a no no nop🥶
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love serah the humble lady with big heart 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The first wife is dying in silence, things that we woman go through,its only that she didnt have a choice,she didnt want to leave her marriage,how can someone be bragging big boy while living in sin?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you're so professional, your interviews are always the best 👏👏👏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a dictator...he made it clear that Serah has no choice.Maureen get your own husband fullstop. You spoiled Serah's happiness and freedom.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most of people here are hypocrites , truth be told most people are players while married to one man or women. Men will always be men , given chance  n money ,no man would settle purely on one lady. If only they would be candid enough they would agree to my sentiments."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is okay she is not happy.. she has always been unlucky.. she mentioned that..  and that sums up everything..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sending love and hugs to the first wife Serah, so much respect to her, she's so humbled mature,calm and loving , wish them all the best, Lyn you are gifted in interviewing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Usitudanganye, ulitaka mtoto ili uwe na mume wa mtu."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm not okay with people normalizing this: First of all,this man is a liar,a cheater and a manipulator..
Maureen,oh well babygirl, nothing you can say justifies this nonsense.
Sarah I don't understand what precedent you are setting,,how much of an example you are to your children,you can't surely stay in this circus!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"do you think one person can love two people at the same time? The question is naïve and obvious at the same time. If a mother and a father can have more than one child and love them all at the same time, then whats so complicated about a man loving more than one woman??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's a difference between parental love and intimacy,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@isabellkinyua2699 you can go ahead and play with the english vocabulary. After all its simply a game/wordplay. The difference is the same
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah open ua eye's wider this is unacceptable I can't
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen should get her own house.She is being used as a money maker.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is oppressed, she is very careful on how to answer questions  as she will keeping stealing glances at Abraham when speaking, also Abraham is constantly cutting her short and answers on her behalf,  but Maureen is free to speak for her self and seems  confident not afraid of the husband ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is obvious Abraham doesn't love sera as much as he loves Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,A red flag for Cera. Abraham very inconsiderate of her & constantly interjecting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ukiongea wewe Abraham si uangalie. Pia serah we can see where your love is stronger
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nashindwa niseme aje, lkn nataka siku niwe kama abraham,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Omg there is still a lot of betrayal.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How I wish I can meet serah and give her a tight hug 🤗. This girl is heartbroken, her eyes tell it all, and the way she is beautiful 😍.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Over my dead body,you should be ashamed of yourself..did your mother carry you for nine months just be mpango wa kando.. what the Lord has but together only death can separate them ,so what can we call you????........ Maureen?? DEATH ...SARAI BE CAREFUL....."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen ni Mzee🤥🤥🤥😏😏😏.she was desperate..pwee bwana ya mtu tafuta wako!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree 👍💯 she looks way older even than the man 😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor cera, I pray God to open doors for you is great ways so that you don’t have to deal with all of that trash. My prayers are on you❤️❤️❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki nooo.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is hurt this people aki ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ngugi....you ask the RIGHT questions!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you🙏🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is so disrespectful hugs Cera☹
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't support
Very discouraged
Polygamy is not right"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wengi wako hivi nikunyamazie tu.
😂😂😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The interview was Okey until the last part ati for the sake of your kids go for it I mean haribia mtu Boma for the sake of love and       mtoto ...aiiiiiiih nooooo..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nkt. You two are just selfish human beings. I swear everything about this story hurts so f...king bad. Messed up how proud he is of his adultery and talks of it with a smile. Nkt. Aki Sera aki pole ghaaai😥😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't admire someone's husband hata akuwe aje. I'm brought up in a polygamous family and I left my husband just because of infedelity. Vile nilijua kabisa kabisa ako na mwanamke nje, I left him and excused the woman to come in the house I built and furnished. Msiniulize Niko wapi saa hii but I'm far much ahead than him and happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's lovable really???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel sera's voice has some tears,at some point nimedhani atalia aki"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this.....aki mapenzi wewe
q4sWUJxjc4g,To live  in same  house is not good
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn I salute you for the way your approaching the three,it's not easy for a man to stay with two wife's in the same house.Lakini Kuna venye Sera has that kafeeling ukimuangalia.Anyway congratulations guys n keep it up."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah loves her husband so so much but her husband doesn't love her. Her husband loves Maureen so so much but Maureen doesn't love him that much. Because she understands this man betrayed her wife.  Mapenzi wewe!!!  It is very clear, Cerah was loosing her husband to Maureen, and to avoid that she had no option but to let Maureen in. I am so sorry for Cerah, she decided to stay despite the betrayal to avoid loosing her husband and the home she had made for all those years. This has been the case to many families that their husbands decide to have mipango za kando and get a child out there."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who am I to judge,Do what makes your you happy, period"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My love for Lynn 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 ,thank you for bringing  such a amazing stories ,live long🥰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The devil is a liar!  Look beyond life, really?!  Bure kabisa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love how maureen has ended
Being raised without a dad is painful and it's has consequences"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham can take care of his child,Maureen did not hv to move in the hse,sleep with someone 's husband in the name of Maureen 's child."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wuueh! A man can still be part of a child's life even without taking the woman as a second wife!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu abraham ni mwanaume mwerevu sana heee
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah u r very mature coz ur husband had already made his decision, may God continue giving u grace coz it's not easy for somebody u loved so much"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you Lynn for the interview.I know you had a reason to do it...But we cannot have a man laughing like this while be knows very well..he betrayed the mother of his kids...he could have easily let Sera live elsewhere and cater for the kids like a GENTLEMAN....but this one is a Narcicist for sure who has held sera hostage because she cannot leave and maybe still loves him and must be in pain....ABRAHAM give us a break....this is bullshit...this is 2022...man up and pick one....as for Maurine..you are beuatiful and deserve better....

To Sera...pole mummy....it shall be well..such people pay hapa tu duniani...

ABRAHAM again...you can not disrespect women this much in 2022...the prayers from the comments will teach you a lesson.The most irritating part about this whole interview is this mans laughter through out the interwiew..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I thank God I left my marriage... This is what my X husband wanted. Imagine ningekua Serah. The pain, betrayal, yaani I feel sad for her..😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Congratulations for leaving! A penis is not a spoon to be used then wash and be used by the next person.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs mummy ❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,What was said in metha ya kagoni it is so different...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's funny how some women are throwing stones at Abraham,I dare you to go through your husband's phone and you'll understand that men are naturally polygamous!!! The only problem Abraham did is staying with both ladies at the same roof.Its not a good show for their kids"
q4sWUJxjc4g,kwenda uko
q4sWUJxjc4g,This trophy 🏆 is for you lynn the interview got me well uy know how and when to  handle such stories.ata tuseme wooh waah Abraham  ameamua two beautiful souls he own them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most of us 90 babies our grandparents had more than one wife mine had 4 it's not out of the norm tuseme tu ourselves we could nevaaa but polygamy does exist. 
WAIT clearly i commented before finishing the video this is NOT the way a true man who is into polygamy should handle things. At least respect wife no 1 enough before having a kid with some1 else please sigh!! At least let her think things thru before having another whole human. Kuna kitu hatuambiwi hapa. But as long as yall are happy i am happy for you. good luck."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What I know ukisema nikuamua to have mpango wa kado or second wife ,that means huna mapenzi na bibi ya kwanza tena.....but Sarah loved Abraham sana..what she needed was am man..father of her kids,and someone who will make her feel loved....this means was one sided love .Abraham didn't care if Sarah will get hurts or not koz alijua he's everything to Sarah koz she loves him.....av been in this situation whereby I loved someone more than my life and its really hurts akikukosea but  still u love him na hutaki aondoke kwa maisha yako....what this is a big betrayal which will affect u mentally and emotionally and its leads to depression if u don't talk it out...for me I prefer a man who will take care of my hrt"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I felt for Serah🥺🥺🥺if he goes to another leaving you he never loved you...I feel cerah's pain inside...if it's like this wacha ndoa ikae 😏 I pray that Serah find happiness and be strong juu she is just pretending like everything is okay but noooooo 😏🥺🥺I agree this is the betrayal of highest order 🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man has managed to convince two women to marry him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I wonder if it will be ok if they said we want to share another husband 😑😑😑😑😑....lol...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen is just a care taker
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hĺmm, I love this!  Truly they look alike!  Lynn thank you for this wonderful interview.   It's unbelievable for co-wives to love themselves that much!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Imagine that if today they got a chance to go abroad e.g to US, UK, he can go only with one wife. What does that tell you?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It can never be me haki. Every woman needs their own space . Imagine your loving husband having sex next door, in the same house just because you want to keep a family 🙆🏿‍♀️🙆🏿‍♀️. I pray that God bless us to be able to empower our girls to NEVER settle because they lacked options. And especially financially"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's very painful people should stop pretending
q4sWUJxjc4g,👌
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am also wondering
q4sWUJxjc4g,I waited for Lynn to pose the question but I wondered how she will.....just can't fathom 😮😮😮
q4sWUJxjc4g,God it's really painful dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This situationship is not for everyone, if truly they are managing well, hands up for them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mi sioni shida 
Na mbona mnasema she isn't ok?
Maybe she is very ok.

Na mm staki hasira za mtu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No no noooooo.. I can't continue listening to this wickedness from Maureen and Abraham.. The sooner these two immoral people seek forgiveness from God the better for them
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a husband snatcher.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah i love u,baraka excess kwako mamii"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is alot which  is withheld and I've listened. He's clearly into Maureen  than Cera. Disrespect. Cera is quietly depressed and trying to smile it.  Just a  matter of time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen looks  older than sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That was a betrayal  , shame on that man and second wife. And he will bring the 3rd wife very soon"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapo kwa clean heart???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mmmh time will tell....we need to hear this love story after 5years,,,what goes Ard must come Ard"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki Lynn that's the best couple l have found in Kenya they are soo strong ad they are not hypothesis ad they are open to each other but l hope hope one day they will have their separate homes l love the couple. May the good Lord bless you Ambraham sd your two wives but don't forget to give God all the groly. Love you guys . From donholm.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honest, love and respect is the best keys for a family setting, we are not God, so long as your happy, contented,displined and focused. God is our forever judge. Wishing you all the best Abraham empire ❤ 😘 sending you hugs and loves ❤"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen kimbelembele mimi unifurahishi plz.sara she is not happy at all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen alll along you thought Abraham will Chase Sera and take over the throne. You new he was married but got to a point of destroying another woman's home However much you try to convince the society..... Sera was betrayed
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1.Before you throw stones, look at yourself first,
2. Don't criticize what you don't know. 
Nothing more to say about this amaaaaazing family we all wish you lifetime endurance, God's favour, God's blessings and may you make the world understand the real meaning of POLYGAMY. MUCH LOVE❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏. 
Thank you Lynn 💋🌹💞."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki Sera I pity her,,this 2nd girl is just pretending but one day she will get tired"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me ndo tu nimeona cerah ni mrembo ama machos
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen Maureen Maureen what were talking about in your coffee dates? If you didn''t know she was married
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sasa my question is you knew he is married mkakosana mkarudiana  but you went ahead you got pregnant why heart another woman and break a family
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah sink more into your personal prayers without this two people.i believe God is going to bring a new thing in your marriage and it will be a positive one. God is there to take all our burdens away.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sad ..story ..Touching  and loving story..Stupid and nonsensical..Confusing
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let God be their guide.... God will see them through all the way and bless them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please let's empower our girls to never accept infidelity and betrayal just because they don't have options.  Let no woman lie to you that they would be ok in such a situation like this. No one
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That's correct,,, for me I can't terolate infidelity even if we had plans and children.... From serah's smile all through the interview someone can tell she has not yet healed...I feel sorry for her...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bullshit there are more women than men and men will always have more women. Take the bitter truth or a lie
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one but them are happy please can you be thinned by your future
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are happy than you
q4sWUJxjc4g,And most probably he has a 3rd chic somewhere..betrayal at its highest point..
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy will still cheat on both of the women...I feel for Serah...she didn't have a choice..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Anyway I don't want to judge but cera is in silence pain, I saw their video about breakfast and I felt for cera been left behind, Abraham love mourine hence they make money together so haezi muacha hata Kwa dawa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Bado atatafuta mwingine wa tatu na amlete,ngojeeni tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even if you decide to marry two wives never let them stay in the same house.. As kikuyu says""
atumia eri ni nyungu ya urogi""
It's okay if you want two.. But in the same house......
Kuna mwenye anabebewa akili hapa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But keep the union of your family  whether in one house or different houses..Ladies keep the friendship but one of you should  agree to suffer be co parent and the other wife....May God  help your family 😓😓 .Sarah sorry once again  unasema usihurumiwe😀😀😀 call a spade a spade..Abraham  umeboa sana be a man by choosing one woman ..one wife..Morine  umeboa sana sana u want a place ya mwanamke co parenting and friendship should  be enough ..u envied Sarah  u wanted her place
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me natype nashindwa kitu ya kuandika 🥲🥲🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Huyu ni fisi tu with 2 desperate women. Surely this is not fair to serah. Did the wife know that he was meeting Maureen? If no,,,, huyu ni FISI tupelekee wajackoyah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen: I think you can see he is lovable 

Red Flag 🚩"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second one just came to destroy kusema tu ukweli aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the question was ""are you HAPPY with the setup?""  and she said ""I'm COMFORTABLE""  and later she said  something very interesting ""nowadays HE seems so happy"",  its not about him sis, what about you? 
Girl I pray you find strength to choose yourself and your happiness. Your body language says a lot really, you not even comfortable on this interview"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mourine and Abraham it may be seen as if you have chosen the best way but that is not Jesus teaching. The bible talks of one man one woman and  having a baby together is not a good reason to come between two lovers. I believe your man is out there waiting for you. Cera agreed to accommodate you because she did not want to loose her husband.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Small disagreements call for coffee dates.. Ladies take notes 👀🥴😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is pure immorality 🤮🤮🤮The family started with Sera moving in for a month after 1st date.She introduced this devil to chama.Being a bros vegetable cutter, ofcoz he was broke.The good home is Seras root ideas blossoming.Ofcoz she built both the man n the home frm scratch n couldn't take the heartbreak of leaving it for this home wrecker😏Ths philaderer man looks proud n wouldn't stop forcing his prostitute into the house.Sera didn't av a choice than holding on her house built frm either her financial contributions or ideas for the comfort of her kids.Then this prostitute,home wrecker wouldn't care bt carry her rotten cursed vagina into the house to harvest where she didn't sow😏Ni kwa muda tu na utakufa Malaya uache boma ya wenyewe🤮Sera nimekutusia yeye mom.Ngoja watatawanyika na ubaki kwako na furaha"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why do I feel so disgusted 🤦, upuzi tupu. It's like first wife hana budi."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wanalala bed moja ama 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,My take is.. Serah had no option... She either was to share or to shape out... She didn't not have a choice...
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a movie itself.. Somebody wake me up
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Serah. May God give her peace all the days of her life.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"38:40 
Moureen is calling
Lynn:heeeee😆😆😆😆"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Even I saw that one weeeuuuhh!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is very demeaning for Cera. My heart goes out to her. Ladies, life is abundant. If one man cant treat you right, if he cant give you respect...gather up your courage,  and move. There other men outside there who would treat you right. Know your worth. Jipende. Weeuh!

You get what you tolerate. Polygamy is a hoax. No matter how people try to glamourize how happy and coexisting they are. Esp to the first wife."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Congratulations Lynn this was a tough one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah knows how to play cards, or else she might ruin her family. When a man discovers someone outside, it is difficult to stop him; the only option is to make more complex decisions."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham went to Maurn knowing very well he's married,did he think of how Sera his wife will be hurt?No
Maurn entertained Abraham and so the two betrayed Sera.
Sera is living with 2 betrayals..
She is not okay but she kept on saying Niko sawa,Niko comfortable.
May God help her to wake up from this sleep"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wah,,,, a whole movie this one. but cera didnt have a choice, i mean they married so young...theres no way shhe was going to lose her home man and family. counting losses and moving on swiftly."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me ask a stupid question...what if Sarah pia alete another man in that  house so that they can be equal with father Abraham...I and myself I can't entatain such bullshit unless men are 12 like disciples
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just love this family, God bless you 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My thoughts,,,,,
It wasn't really fair for Abraham to see Maureen while he knew he had Serah
I'm just trying to imagine how that made her feel as a woman
Plus,,, if Abraham really had to marry Maureen, he should have gotten her another house
That being that,,,
I wish you guys a happy ""marriage"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is a mirage even...wait n see.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine mtu akikuletea bibi ya pili ukiwa this young with small kids....I know first wife hakuwa na other choice except accepting and live with pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who else is sending love & hugs to Serah?
 I feel she has stomached a lot. 
I lost Serah when she said she was very much ok. You don't need to prove if you are. 
May happiness find you again Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"She didn’t have to stomach anything. She had a choice to walk out of this nonsense. She still has a choice. But whatever reason, she has chosen to stay."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera!  You are a very beautiful young woman, but your husband has already shown you who he is.  What stops him from repeating it again???"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish Cerah comes to her senses, this other woman might kill her, watch"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@lydiahnyaboke2302 cheiii its not that  serious
q4sWUJxjc4g,body language telling it all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nature of work pushed u? Really Abraham? Nonsense.. U need God more than u need 2nd woman.. Maureen be prepared to a pay back time.. 3rd woman loading cos Abraham has lust for women
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Having another wife is not the problem ,but having affair  to an extend of having a baby without wife's knowledge is pure betrayal,trust is lost that a fact..Serah agreed since she didn't have an option....this are young people soon or later things will change!!!you can take this to bank!!Serah'a eyes will open up and she will stand firm for her!!xoxo to Serah!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a selfish man- He agrees to have felt guilty & couldn't disclose to Maureen that he is married for the fear of loosing her😳. At this point he had already replaced Cera having it blissful with Maureen. You can tell Cera is still hurting- in a denial stage , the real her will wake up one day.  Lust is infinite- He will chase another light, heeled, clean, entrepreneurial woman! He could be having a dirty secret life that will be shocking one day. - Manipulation & open infedelity!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is soo beautiful, a cool, humble n kind hearted, than the 2nd wife for real,wat do men rilly want🤔🤔the hardest thing in this world is to understand our men."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moreen please,why don't you find your own Man,I feel for cera,and one day one tyme pay back is there, karma is real"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"the movie ""He watches over me""..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's too annoying and full of himself
q4sWUJxjc4g,real love and business love halooo serah work hard
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is the real wife huyu mwingine ni mpango wa kando she should jst go no way io upuzi siezi taka
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For a polygamous family to stand strong and work,it depends with the man.. I applaud you Abraham and your wives for making this  arrangement work. God bless your family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Their is no God their,christianity one man,one wife,till death do as part.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am glad you are calling it an arrangement, and not a marriage. Calling it a marriage is an insult to the institution of marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn u hve started wearing short dresses.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The names, Sarah, Abraham, this one needs the Emoji we are waiting for...deep down Sarah is not happy, she's in this because she feels she has to. 
Shame of a man......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When my husband tried that joke, I divorced him. No regrets"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,👍👍👍kudos.vile inafaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,💪
q4sWUJxjc4g,💪💪💪 That's how it should be
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly how it should be done!✅
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My great grandfather was doing it and it was working. Now that Abraham is doing it, his queens on their own terms decided to live together. If it can't work for you, that's you don't spread hate. I love them and let them be❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don’t think your grandfather had his wives living in the same house. Traditionally, every wife had their own house and compound. Plus, that was probably a few decades ago. To have a young man like this, in 2022, proudly parading two women as his wives, living together in the same house is pathetic."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@blessedwachera7133 and didn't you hear from previous interviews that Abraham has built each one a house. It's the women who mutually agreed to live together independent of Abraham. Also on my grandpa, the wives lived in the same house"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are all free to air our opinions.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii ni uongo kabisa. There is no truth although I have heard the story. There is no way you can have same feelings for two women. Hii ni usanii
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really had a headache listening to this..Oh Serah,you deserve better😢"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Once a woman knows her worth,she will never settle for less."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You said it all!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeeh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lesson don't start low with a man once they get money they forget very easily.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah u  suffer serious low esteem..na kwa sababu ulipata shida nyingi..you can't let him go...Trust in God before meeting him God took care of you..He will help you even if you leave him ..He is not your husband..Let him marry you  or leave  you..What a compromise  Sarah..hata Sarah og ilimshida😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Ngungi wewe!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He is awful; for betraying his wife, for abusing her emotionally and telling her he will not stop seeing his mistress... he is exceedingly selfish - notice, listen to him carefully - his concern was not how his wife felt but about the possibility of losing them both - I hope Cerah is happy.  My prayer is that Cerah finds the strength to leave them both.  He is God awful.  Selfish."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfish man 😰
q4sWUJxjc4g,uuui serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if she is ok with this arrangement?
q4sWUJxjc4g,All this time I'm waiting to hear an instance where he defended Serah adi I had to come kwa comment section niconform kama i'm being biased...the guy is definitely no longer in love with Serah and I feel like he's only keeping her to maintain his image out here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,My advice to Search: girl know your worth and remember love is the bare minimum you deserve more. The truth might hurt but only for a while but a lie daaaaaaamn a lie destroys a lifetime bro
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen mwenyewe sio msupu vile she looks old look at the face while Sarah is Soo cute 🥰 n natural ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"WOMEN WILL ALWAYS BREAK RULES IF THEY MEET A HIGH VALUE MAN. ANYWAY WE ARE IN THE PERIOD OF SEXUAL REVOLUTION THATS WHY YOU WILL SEE SUCH THINGS LIKE LGBTQ, CONTRACT MARRIAGES ETC"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one can convince me that serah is happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,i think serah is a wise woman her happiness  comes first.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So am I
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Absolutely
q4sWUJxjc4g,happy for this foolishness???
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woiye hugs dear Serah😭😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some people think Sarah is a ‘victim’ she looks happy to me . She is just composed and very calm lady. Some of this things only God knows how he will judge . Why get annoyed with this beautiful while we have millions of kids who have been abandoned by men some who are married that’s where you need to get angry at!! Not this beautiful family. STOP BE HYPOCRITICAL!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeh
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love how lyn do her thing. She is just perfect in asking exactly what we want to hear
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks younger and more beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No man can love two ladies equally..one will suffer silently .trust me  this is impossible.
And I can see cerah is on pain .
God fight for cerah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham  and Morine..the annoying part is  you want to show public its ok  what you are doing ..Now  Abraham you messed up bro...I don't judge but you messed up ..umemuumiza sana huyo mwanamke  Sarah..au muache au umrudishie heshima yake..Uliona lini ndoa ya watu watatu ..kasome Jesus alisema from beginning Mungu designed a union between  a man and woman not women..embu acha ufirauni na kuja public kutuonyesha uupuzi.. Kama huyo Sarah humpendi mwache in mature way muoe huyo side chick wako...maana huna ndoa wewe..wed one of them in Church  and Co parent with another ..other wise ni shida tu unatengeneza..  one thing nakusifu is that you care for your kids and that's the spirit..keep on .I pity Sarah you don't love her at all and you told the truth even if that was the end of you two..but Morine has to stay..what a bitter truth...I wonder.if Sarah is the bread.earner...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah looks unhappy,her body language tells so..I really feel for her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just felt hurt 😿🤕🤕 watching this.maureen really
q4sWUJxjc4g,Only lesbians can be comfortable in this zone.... they have the lesbianism thing in them and they don’t know🙌🏻give them time.🌝
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can't imagine what's going on Cerah's mind. Imagine seating with your husband and other wife talking of how you got played.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kindly Lynn not on a bad note but avoid such interview that promote immorality to the society.Serah is a woman in pain we can see it.this lady is in pain but for Maureen honestly you will get the reward of getting into someone marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's kinda disturbing watching this vedio..I don't know when we women got here, some women will go to extreme extents because of Money.Thank you Lynn for the interview"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Second wife looks elder than the first,,n she's more beautiful than Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I see that too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is normal here in Uganda may be in Kenya it's a miracle
q4sWUJxjc4g,This dude seems to love maureen more
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weh! Hii ni kali no judgement though
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah hurts but God will fight fr her...time will tell . She may look weak but God will fight fr her  . Underline this statement. Betrayal by Abraham ad Maureen. Continue pretending
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is there now a 3rd one?😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wah...what do i say.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,I remember my lecturer told us 'learn to be humble but in principle'    . There are boundaries that cannot be crossed I feel cera knows that this was not ok but akaamua my sweep matters under the carpet
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ones an intruder always it will remain in eyes of the beholder. Love is fr 2. Aka erí ní nyúngú igírí cia ÚROGI
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah looks young than morryn
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn u've nailed it... questions on point
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1st date question: do you think polygamy would ever be an option for you and are you willing to sign a pre-nup that anything we earn together before you marry a 2nd wife ,I will get 75%?
Women ,hope is for the weak. If trust was a thing ,lawyers would never be in business; Cover your angles."
q4sWUJxjc4g,In metha ya kagoni show when this story first aired alot was said subtly... Anyways... 👀👀
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ulisahau tu kuuliza how they sleep ama wanalala bedroom moja
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is hurting but she is in denial 😪😪😪
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truth be told,There's nothing like being comfortable in such a marriage..mostly the 2nd,3rd and so forth are the ones who are happy..the 1st can never be happy/comfortable however much she tries..ni kuamua tu kukaa and getting used to it..anyway not to judge, life happens differently for different people"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This are fake smiles, not genuine🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata mimi I want a married man. At least washamaliza kustruggle na maisha na bibi yake so nitakuja tu kuenjoy mali yao as a second wife😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ati alijam juu first wife alikuwa kwa phone, maureen ako funny😂😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Loving two people the equally,comes with some hypocrisy cause its not possible at all! After 2-3 years down the line,he is going to meet another one and brings her home again.It will go on and on until they are 10 of them.
His problem is being a cassanova and thats it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,You seem to forget that Abraham and Serah are not married so casting stones at Maureen is misguided. These are three adults who have made a choice and only they will deal with the consequences. You need to keep your woiye views about  Serah and self righteous comments about Abraham and Maureen to yourselves.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's so bad to invent another woman's home, it's bad., not biblical at all. GOD HELP US"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aiii anti effecient in her workplace???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Maureen is a homebreaker.. Don't sanitize her. Sarah just braved it.. The pain is still evident in her face. 
NB. if a woman gets into another woman's family the same will happen to her. Maureen ngojea mwingine kutoka kwani Abraham 😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,And it's pathetic  I happen to hear a story of another side chick called Morine ..na alimshikilia mwanaume ambaye alikuwa Tahiti kwelikweli mpaka akawa second wife...na mwanaume alikuwa hasiikii haambiwi..na first wife akitaka fedha anaambiwa muulize  Morine...pathetic aMorine  alimuua huyo mwanaume walipokuwa na ugomvi accidentally ...and she owns everything..Sarah watch out..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I’m not going to put entire BLAME ON Maureen,i blame the MAN 1000% he clearly knew he had a wife & went seeking for another relationship out there,he started it all!! If It was not Maureen I’m pretty sure it would have been someone else,on the other hand Maureen should have stuck to her guns,our subconscious never lie,one thing that bothers me is the fact that a MAN cannot accept having his wife bringing him another man as a co-husband if there’s anything like that but we women are forced to accept whatever may,married women have men who ask them out but since most of them respect their hubbies & marriages they usually decline even if it’s flattering"
q4sWUJxjc4g,For sure i love this family  the last part made me cry waoooh lovely family
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Great job Lynn, you were very composed and ready for this interview 👏🏾😘. Meanwhile, mapenzi wewe......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish Abraham to bring another woman so that we can see if Moureen will accept her in as Sarah did,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope sera is not in that marriage because of the kids.she looks sad 😞
q4sWUJxjc4g,I still shout my view all the way from first view from metha ya kagoni.sarah doesn't seem.happy it obvious she just ddnt av achoise bt to to accept Abraham's other woman of his class n work level..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good job Lynn! Had watched their previous interviews and for sure there was so much more that was revealed in your show. Love the atmosphere.. quite relaxed & light hearted. ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let serah stay but this is trauma that can lead to depression in future trying to make the society happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morine if I were you ..I 'll leave this family alone and maintain the best relationship  Sarah  and you allowed it...But cut all love affairs ..And  either stay single or get married  to another per son.Leave them alone...your baby has the father and mother co parent..Leave them or Marry Abraham and let Sarah go and she should be the one to coparent..and you Wed in Church.. But  I advice you leave this family alone..hakuna ndoa ya watatu.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Ngugi you are not only an interviewer but a great counselor..... Wow May God continue using you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@LynnNgugi Blessings
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kama wanapendana sita judge
q4sWUJxjc4g,Imagine sitting next to ur hubby as he tells on how he cheated on u with ur now co wife 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maurine isn’t genuine. She can’t even answer questions genuinely because she’s guilty n embarrassed coz she hurt another woman. Oh my goodness Sarah!!!! Sorry for what yo going thru. I hope u get out of this situationship alive n strong. Maurine intended to destroy another woman’s marriage to the extent of moving into their house 🤦‍♀️. I hate this whole episode. We r not supposed to normalize immorality
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is living every woman's greatest nightmare. She is beautiful, I pray she gives up the
 "" resilient wife"" face, cry it out and move out."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah has been enjoyed. Ati Abraham knows Serah too well how she would react. Anyway its about kids he didn't want to be far from his kids it's not love!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah has been enjoyed. Ati Abraham knows Serah too well how she would react. Anyway its about kids he didn't want to be far from his kids it's not love!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn is just a vibe💕💕💕💕💕I love your interviews
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceras love is true love..Kama alikupenda ukikata mboga na after kupata another one boom
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacha watu wapendane if you can't handle duo sim it's ok for me it can't work mostly in the same house but for those blessed to have that love go for it am happy for this family may God always give them peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Also something that they failed to mention in THIS interview is that Abraham had always wanted a second wife even at the start of him and Serah, so hold your rocks people"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And that is when Serah should have said no and ended the relationship. By staying, she was sending the message to Abraham that she was okay with his future plans to marry a second wife. And when the wife came, she had no grounds to protest, because she had already been informed."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Better nikae single kuliko ivi!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah don't be a babysitter, go out gal get love out there, lets see in 5years time its too early"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I expected father Abraham to be a big man 😀 kumbe bado ni mdogo?
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is auquered
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are small details in this entanglement. 1. he calls himself Abraham(we all know who Abraham is and how many wives he had) 2. sera calls herself Sara ( Abraham first wive) 3. their YouTube channel is called Abrahams empire (ie he is runs the show) . 4. he says Maureen is not allowed to leave him( she is a grown woman she can decide what she wants)hope both women find the strength to tell themselves the truth because nobody should feel like they are not enough
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah isn't happy,every human being has some level of jealousy,she can keep lying that she is okay but deep down it hurts like hell.one maybe she will open her inner eyes because I feel like she is lost . meanwhile,let's empower our daughters so that they won't have to take such kind of bullshit!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera looks betrayed from the look of her face ,she is just being strong ,maybe she has a reason to why amestay asiwache ndoa yake ,bt for me I would prefer kustay Kwa nyumba yangu as I respect Serah house 🥺 Moureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder what would have happened if Maureen was was the first wife 😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morine..what I see is you envied the place of Sarah...after having a baby ofcourse..you wanted her place... and it's natural...but remember it's very easy to turn back on you...Abraham  may do the same to you just as he did to Sarah...and since you wanted her place badly you stay were ready to befriend her...it's psychology of most side chicks...Abraham  speaks highly of you but you stoop so low...Though Sarah suffers  low self esteem..but so are you
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel your pain Serah.....you deserve better mami
q4sWUJxjc4g,Living in a dream world
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bullshit 1st before I even watch the whole of episode..... i will have another opinion after I finish watching...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn Lyn???????
q4sWUJxjc4g,But he truly loves Maureen period ...He found true love later it's a fact ....Sera just stayed cze they have kids he loves Maureen too much.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wah! This is happening in Kenya!. Cera, u really have a big heart. Me never! Maurine, u have guts. Father Abraham weee! I hope u wont go for the 3rd,4th, and 5th wife. Anyway all the best the Abrahams."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I refuse and cant put up. He can have whoever out there and whatever kids. The day i will know....he will have to have them. I leave....i value my heart and what i offer i expect the same. There is no respect in unfaithfulness to begin with both from the man and the intruder!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mercy triumphs over judgement.  We are called to love all full stop! That is the life Christ requires of us. He alone is the judge.
q4sWUJxjc4g,We cannot justify infidelity..period you cheated and she stayed and this it a timed bomb the aftermath is mayhem..period!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is such a darling 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No, she is not, she destroyed a family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A darling? No. She’s a home wrecker. A promiscous woman who had an affair with a married man, had his baby, and then moved into a married woman’s home. She has no self respect or self worth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaah God let me never go through this.. she is still hurting! I  could not watch it to the end am getting angry.
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Benjaminzulu was here he would ask.....why do you think a partner overstays even after she realizes that she's not loved?
q4sWUJxjc4g,How about love as Lynn asked u......uyu mtu hapendi cerah walai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its not that Mauryn genuinely cared about Serah, every woman needs a man for her own self the moment she heard the guy was already married she knew she was wasting time with someones husband!! This is so annoying"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morine angalia uhusiano wako na Mungu kupendwa na mtu hakukupi right ya kumchukua mwanaume wa mtu..but since they are not married  you took the chance...you could as well deny yourself  and think of Sarah ..you are beautiful you could have   married another fellow..But if you think you are meant to be together ...go on Marry Abraham  and let Abraham leave Sarah...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah has a big heart n because of love she accepted the other woman , but reality check no sane woman wishes to see his man bringing another woman in their home eti ni co-wife mmmhhh NO . wish them well though... ..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pure Infidelity and Betrayal.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah may God open doors for you and give you the Grace to free yourself.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah’s eyes speaks volumes, deep pain and betrayal , sugarcoated infidelity, he clearly said it’s either this way or no way,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True sugarcoating cheating
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is in pain... The kind of pain you can Cleary see in her eyes.. The husband cheated and went ahead kuleta sidechick home.may God give the 1st wife the strength to move on.. Mimi kwangu hii ni bullshit!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why am I even crying.I wish your family happiness.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly I'm tearing, cringing and trembling just imagining how I would if my hubby did that to me, how terrible to find out the way Serah did."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hi Lynn. I have always appreciated what you do, and also made comments both in YouTube and LinkedIn to express support of what you are doing. But this very show requires a re-think. You have to seriously vet what you show. It is very deceptive for a man to say he marries two wives, and the two of them are very happy with his decision. You don't give your platform for anyone to promote what is inappropriate. God is against polygamy. Don't let anyone use your platform to promote the lies about polygamy. There is never an instance where polygamy is as good as being married to one wife. It was so irritating when I saw the man holding the hands of both women, I don't think I spent more than 1 minute on the video. Of course, the second woman who came later may be ok, but the first woman would never feel ok. There is nothing about polygamy that is contributory to great family. If the man truly loves his first wife, there would not have been room for another one to come and join them. As an influencer, don't let anyone use you show to promote what is not right. May God give you divine insight into what I am trying to share with you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,As a wife I can't begin to imagine the  pain of this betrayal..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes
q4sWUJxjc4g,ask me.....it's deep
q4sWUJxjc4g,You just sound jealous ! Don't be suprided that your husband has 3 women out there.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ngai sikwa ubad lakini  ziwesi Ata kama atakua akaae mbali from my heart
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mapenzi wewe😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn u are so amazing. So creative. I can't judge. Wish them all the best. My hugs to Sarah . She is areally strong lady.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen pretends to be innocent is she cared that much she should have stopped Abraham.Did her conscious tell her not to mess up this marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Confused by comments about serah being unhappy. Please let’s not project, we are all different. She was obviously upset at first but she has found friendship with the second wife. Let them be, life is not a one size fits all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morine ..Morine I pity you..naelewa situation umejikuta..  and I don't judge you at all ..you are loved and you are in love..but swali moja ukimpenda mtu baadaye ukagundua au ni padri au ni baba yako au ni Kaka yako won't you stop? And retain the basic relationship ? Na wewe ulivyogundua Ana mke you should have stopped... Sikujudge I am single mom too with a man whom I think  alikuwa  kama wako ..It's tough...naelewa what you  went thru alone crying and wanting the dad to be  there...But listen  you can bear the fruits of your deeds and leave these two alone...you are a woman ...yes you destroy their family...and if the man loves you let him marry you and leave his first family .hakuna ndoa ya watatu ..unamuumiza mwenzio  while smiling at her..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So the man just went for what he wanted, not caring about his wife. He is the one having the best of it all..😑"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They have a beautiful Home

A handsome Man

Let love thrive in their home,if they are very ok,sisi ni kina nani. All the best to Abraham's Empire"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What an amazing love story, God’s guidance at work. Thank you Lynn"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lol!
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is just a case of two Narcissists preying   on an Empath. I hope Serah finds herself and gets the strength to leave.Women should learn to chose themselves.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Iam glad someone noticed narcissism here the manipulation, intimation, reverse psychology, and tourture inflicted on sera. Maybe she doesn't know now but later her answers will be in their statements they gave. Iam disgusted"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh God of heaven, no man can love two souls uongo Wacha too ,serah my God help u n open your eyes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said.Two selfish individuals who think so higy of themselves.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mary only chosen ones are able to see this. Sarah has already been taken through the full cycle of love bomb, devalue and discard. I hope she will educate herself fast enough and break the pattern. Triangulation is what is happening now."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You are lying to your fellow women, women should stay with their men even if he brought in another 3rd wife. Women are most happy under a Man. Westernization should not apply to men of means who are ready to take a number of women under their wings."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy wasn't scared of losing serah, otherwise he wouldn't have done this"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the way here their is no love, Abraham is just a lustourours man,no love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm pissed off, I feel for serah. She is worth more than the crap her guy is selling. Abraham doesn't love serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sin is sin. Period!!! 
They can be wonderful people but it still doesn't change that fact. I am not saying that I am perfect either ( in case anyone will want to comment) . From listening here, I hear infidelity in  a marriage, he cheated and the 2nd woman knew he was married. That alone is an unhealthy foundation to start with, and I know God is not pleased with this despite of how well they make it seem. He is the originator of marriage and his instructions is the only one that governs the institution.
The 1st wife has wisdom in treating a man right I must admit but still seems to be hurting"

q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you have zero conscious and you will pay for this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wishing you the very best Abrahams. You are being honest to yourselves. And this is true love and no one has the right to judge you guys. We all marry strangers...at least Mwangi is sane enough to come out than the hypocrisy most Kenyan men have from time immemorial of keeping side chicks and siring kids until they appear on your death bed. Please give us a break this is better. Kudos to Mr. Mwangi....and by the way am your mother who is turning 61 this year and I admire your guts...don't listen to the haters..we mothers have been through soooo much raising you 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 wishing you the very best. Enjoy Cerah you have a helper in soooo many ways 🙏🏾❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is just a caniver shame just listen to.yourself
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh🤦too much mixed feelings on this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen what s rutless doesn't care and she is a go getter waiting and scheming for Cera to leave Abraham for her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn never disapoint in questions I love u soo much ...then Lynn anafeel nkaa n yy ameongezewa co-wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sending hugs to Sarah  Soo much pain in her woii ngai fungua Sara macho ndaguthaitha
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Maureen is an agressive street girl sooo sad.Sarah got sooo hurt and is yet to get over it and move on
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like we kikuyu  we have to talk some kikuyu words in between stories 🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hapa iko shida Sarah got sooo hurt 🤕 she is still hurting and in denial.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A good woman can not intentionally come into/get involved with another woman’s husband willingly,,,,this Maureen lady ain’t it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well done Lynn. Pinning down this guy with hard questions. Men are just strange creatures!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacha niseme tu. Number 3 is on the way. Watch this space. This Abraham is full of it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki Cera you must have alot of Grace.not many can stand this including me🤭 naskianga 2 wives are like a pot of witchcraft 🤔all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,How would he react if cera brought another man in the picture?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"More power to you all, whatever floats your boat. If serah is happy I’m happy. How this convo would go down in my house
Hubby - I’m looking for a co-wife
Me - Actually lets get a co- husband first, I have someone in mind 🤓
Halafu?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,But why are you so funny 😂😂🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why do I feel l, Serah benefits more  than Maureen?  Someone seeing the same?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He keeps refering to Cera as sasa huyu! He is soo selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There was no love at first sight for Maureen and Abraham,there was either lust and greediness.For Serah,she had no other option her having three two kids at that time and a third child was on the way.she had to tolerate.I feel there some kind of disrespect for Serah.The other thing is if Maureen was in Serah's shoe,and she was the first wife and Abraham brought in a second wife high chances she wouldn't accept that.Its a relationship that has been bound by lust.I wish them the very best though, but it's immoral."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly iiiii ni ujinga, 😏😏😏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hate is a strong word but I hate this guy!! I literally raised my middle finger and immediately stopped watching his none senses as soon as he said the questions were pressing for him🤣!!! Hate him!!!!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfish man
q4sWUJxjc4g,He cheated period! No sugar coating. Problem of marrying hustlers...Ile siku watashika pesa aki..they geuka sana.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah kama mmeishi hakukupeleka kanisani ..wala popote hakukuoa  correct this now ...Go ...and your kids will be ok tu..wewe ndio come to visit..basi na Mungu atakusaidia ..hao wanapendana na watakuumiza sana..Remember  your man must choose hakuna ndoa ya watatu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki Lynn SOFTLY COMMANDS the truth out of people’s hearts in a way that I’m YET to see from other journalists…. Keep going mama. We are here to broaden our knowledge….👏🏽👏🏽
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The two know Sarah’s nature and have taken advantage of it 😔 he knows she loves him too much to let him go 
Maureen to you … be rest assured your replacement is loading because if he could take advantage of the love he was given by Sarah ? Yours will NOT be enough"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nobody is willing to share the man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,No One can love two women equally .it's a lie .ad uncalled for.u are a second wife period
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great interviewing skills there! However 'the ability to impact lives' in this story is so slim
q4sWUJxjc4g,"See women here cursing Sarah when there husband have women out there wamewanunulia mashamba na magari. Cerah is a smart and intelligent lady, she knew how to handle the situation. Honestly I would do the same if he was honest enough to face the truth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true most of them aren't married yet..they think it's easy to get a husband wait till they hit 30s being single then they will understand mourines situation
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hmm...it's a difficult situation,  at least he had the guts to tell  Maureen he was married.  Others lie and get you fully involved and committed just to learn later you have been fooled. As one matures, you let go of a lot of things, but deep down, it's only the heart that truly knows what it feels. It's never easy. I wish them the best,  joy, friendship and lots of understanding."
q4sWUJxjc4g,wow men keep finding new ways to destroy women. Tujipende tu roho safi na tutafute pesa zetu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't watch youtube stories stupidly mimi I have bought my buroti, nimejenga if my husband start this rubbish I'm gone.
Ndikwenda urimu. IL never build any shit with any man kila Mtu ajijenge"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I find this Abraham very selfish.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah kama unaweza kubeba pain na kukubali huyo mwanamke  mwingine you can do right by taking tough journey... Sarah Jesus was asked ni sawa kudivorce akasema ni kwa sababu ya ugumu wa mioyo  yetu lakini tangu mwanzo Mungu aliumba Adam na Hawa ..  na Hata Abraham ilibidi amuondoe Hagai and when he was hesitant God told him to let Hagai .Sarah it's Godly if you  allow that man to have the  wife he wants..one wife ...If  he doesn't let Hagai go ..you Go ....correct  you lives Sarah you are strong you are not married to Abraham  and Abraham isn't God..
q4sWUJxjc4g,She said she is very ok and we shouldn't worry about her 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very sad😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sincerely speaking I've seen ceras true feelings in this and I feel for her but also Ma -Deputy Jesus 
Seems You really needed work to pass  judgement

q4sWUJxjc4g,Am not judging but moureen anakaa kudanganya she isn't straight previous interview she didn't say much
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have typed and deleted on the comments section many times it’s clear I have nothing to say.
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's clearly in love with Maureen .he's just kind enough not to leave the first wife .out of respect and guilt..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Narcissistic husband , I feel sorry for serah😥."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A very romantic man
It's not easy to leave him"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a real definition of end time
q4sWUJxjc4g,Are we saying he was not contented with the first love so he had to go for a second one? How did that make the first wife feel to even be able to go to the wall and bow down to a second one and make a share??
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah you are hurt very much...I can imagine your situation...it's very good for the kids .but remember you are not married in church ...He has a right to marry ... since he loves his woman and told you  she is  going anywhere  and he was ready if your family ends that day..Leave him...there is no marriage of three people...hujaolewa na huyo mtu my dear to say unatetea ndoa
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have noticed this ladies somehow look alike.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wooiii dear God please help me love myself more and more..because wooiii I don't have the heart to put up with such
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have followed this story for weeks. Sarah is being played by both of them. Has this man declared his love to Serah individually like he has to the other home breaker? My heart  breaks for Serah. May God sustain her strength  and bless her family and business.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Trust our Kenya Oprah ONLY L&N can do it like this!!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾another job well executed LN, keep them coming we are sitting on the edge of the chair waiting🌺🌺🌺"

q4sWUJxjc4g,First time they hugged!! Sarah needed a shoulder to cry on!! Besides she understood she was in a fix. All in all Sarah had a good heart. About Maureen no words traitor!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn's prowess in interviewing guests and especially in such a unique case like this one, and help us get the answers to the questions we all have, is quite top-notch!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You look happy and that’s all that manners. ignore the haters and enjoy yourselves 😜
q4sWUJxjc4g,The truth is uncomfortable.... Pain is inevitable here.. Waambie tu Ukweli
q4sWUJxjc4g,We need to learn to MYOB...
q4sWUJxjc4g,They made it our business when they brought it to social media 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You see how the husband & the second ""defend"" themselves at every opportunity? Hmmm
""I don't regret anything"",  ""I didn't know he was married"" lol
Polygamy only benefits men. I don't care how much the first puts up a front...... But if she thinks that that's the best setting for her, then maybe it is what she deserves. All the best to them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah, 
Enough with having his babies. 
When you go back to work and you find your SOUL MATE there don't hesitate, nayo nayo.....
I hope you find yourself a husband even in your 50's and leave this Kinuthia."

How many monogamous relations and marriages, are a shumble just for appearances sake? btw Lynn this Ras Loves you great Job"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The baby crying behind the scene is making me so uncomfortable
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just love the interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why would you give birth with a married man ndio ukuje useme if a kid if a kid sijui koso koso
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would have wished to watch and cover Abraham but I can't. He is getting me so mad
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So when Abraham was cutting sukuma wiki, why was he not thinking of loving two people?  Would Maureen love him then?? The point is, Abraham betrayed Sera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is an engineer kuna siku alikata sukuma
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was Abt to ask that would Maureen love him then
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes he used to katakata skuma. Listen to metha ya kagoni interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So painful to watch this....this lady Sarah needs some therapy. This man clearly has no much love for her or the guilty is just too much. Note he cannot even look her directly like Maureen. The dude and the 2nd wife work together, go together. This is just painful but it's cos Sarah had no other option, we should empower gal child some embarrassments are a no."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nijikute
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hugs Serah. She looks okay but deep down she is hurting.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is jealous like me? I can't knowingly share a husband. I would rather live single.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the look,,Cera isn't ok...her eyes tells it all ..her heart is somehow hurt but she had no choice,,I think Abraham spending more time with Maureen (at work and home),Cera is somehow affected and think she needs counseling"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love this. can I be the 3rd wife🥰lol.... honestly I wld not mind such love
q4sWUJxjc4g,O.m.G...feel like crying on behalf of serah..she's clearly not happy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The standard of God about marriage will never change. Maureen came to destroy,you might see it all thriving but it won't end well. May God see cerah through."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen barely makes eye contact with Serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera you are so so beautiful so so much beautiful if you are reading this just know it's a matter of time
q4sWUJxjc4g,If GOD calls it sin! No other words or social media can change it. This is sin before GOD. Repent and live according to GOD'S laws. Every sin done intentionally will be paid dearly.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Baad.Umalaya promax
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham,  Serah must really love you!  Her love is genuine because she accepted you when you had nothing but Maureen….comments you will get"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nothing to be proud about! Maureen is a Jezebel! Delilah! Breaking someone's home! How do you sleep at night,knowing next room Kuna mwanamke alivunja ndoa yako! Cheei!
Cera mami,you're beautiful! Ignore this Jezebel! Save save save! But don't settle with this guy! Take your time,make sober decisions! This guy is just another idiot! We love you Cera!
We love you Lynn!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen cannot explain a thing on how she decided to have a baby with this guy knowing Cera was there . She did it deliberately.
q4sWUJxjc4g,the pain in Sarah can even been seen again mwanamke akiwa  financiallyl stable is the best weapon
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera....Don't give up,God is on your side.Take care of your kids they are the ones who will give you real love.When I look at you I see the beautiful winnie Mandela.Take heart gal."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm not watching this confusion.
For now all three of you are okay but ones kids grow, choose careers that's where jealousy and hatred starts.
We will be waiting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham come here!! I heard you repeat several times that you love Maurine but I didn't hear you say you love Sarah!! Kwani what is love!! The lady you started life with you when you were zero should be your first love regardless!! I feel sad for Sarah, she is humble, beautiful and the kind of wife any man would desire, anyway ebu henjio ni makwa!!!! All in all Maurine, you are in this marriage coz the guy is rich but hiyo Mali walitafuta na Sarah!! Sarah, may God give you wisdom to deal with those two..... .I really feel for Sarah!! Maurine All along u knew the the guy is a family man! Thank you Lyn for the interview!! You asked the kind of questions we wanted to hear"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera amesema yeye yuko tu sawa and no one should feel sorry for her. She is happy 🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@bellaolum9768 I know right but deep inside is she? I hope she is. No woman would be happy inside in this kind of set up.. am sure if Maureen was the first n Cera the second, that house could be on fire.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So it was a cheating situation, and the 1st wife stayed for the kids.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,She had no choice other than accept we women tunajijua deep down
q4sWUJxjc4g,Do you have to stay in the same house really? This is so humiliating.. Too bad for Sarah..
q4sWUJxjc4g,And the way the guy is full of himself!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii ni jokes hapa,anyway am here to see how it goes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I DON'T THINK MOREEN IF SHE WAS THE FIRST WOULD HAVE STAYED IN THAT HOUSE. SELFISH NATURE. YOU ASKING ABOUT HER WHEN YOU ARE HAVING HER HUSBAND FOR HER SUCH AUDACITY. I THOUGHT JUDY AUSTIN WAS ONLY IN NIGERIA..

q4sWUJxjc4g,This Maureen is a home wrecker.  Who told you Cera couldn't build her family for you to come help build. Shame on you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Traditionally polygamy is acceptable in some parts of Africa but the first wife has to be part of the process as she is consulted and her permission is sought first and she can even help choose the second wife for the husband.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham thought ameshida akakuta ameshidwa.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The pain in Sarah's eyes!!!

Cerah clearly point it out that: she don't like it when people call her Sara but Abraham and the other wife call her Sara. Their guilt conscious is killing them. I really really feel for Cerah, she is hurting and I hope Maureen and Abraham have good intentions.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a selfish man! This works perfectly for him!!!!! I feel sorry for the first wife. Both of these other adults betrayed her. This other woman had all the power to leave when she found out this selfish man was married. How do you go ahead do have a child with him and sit there and talk about being a good person? That’s bullshit!

Sarah, please, if you ever see this! I hope you find the strength to leave this arrangement. Leave him, run, remove yourself from the triangle and see how these two work! Your presence is only making their relationship stronger"

Women wake up and have standards you don’t have to stay where you are not truly valued and respected. 10years from today you will see the end of this whole thing that looks all beatiful while we know there is no happiness and intimacy!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the second time am listening to this story and av seen Abraham very selfish, not empathetic towards his wife sera. Maureen had an intention of breaking sera’s family that’s why she decided to get pregnant to keep the man. That’s why she couldn’t explain the question as at what point did she decide on making the baby with a married man. May God reward Serah with lots of blessings pay the pain she’s going through."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very well said!!!💯💯💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,This for me is a noo this guy doesn't love Cerah Mungu ni epushe na hizi shida za kusota ...coz I can't
q4sWUJxjc4g,These two ladies both have pure hearts
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I love your questions sweetie
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen looks like the older woman👵. Sarah's nature is what will keep the three coded rope tight. She sounds so mature.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Btw kwa miaka cera is the youngest
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sending hugs to serah 
She’s looks hurt still 🥺🥺"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs Sera,,umepitia machungu,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one is going to talk how Maureen looks old to father Abraham...msijifanye hamuoni
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is the one who says Abraham umenitupa sana...😌 May God help this woman woii. Never subject your wife into this kind of nonsense 😒
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just scam, trying hard to normalize polygamy,it's not easy living with a another woman under one roof, Serah is being tolerance because he so desperate to keep the man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a player...period!! Toxic!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eti sasa huyu🤔🤔🤔🤔......if I were cerah🏃🏃🏃
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have an advise for young women, go to school, work hard , get a job and become financially secure. If Sarah was financially secure, there was was no way she could have put up with this  marital abuse. She had no otherwise but to humble herself and live with the devil, or can I say the two devils?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah ua happiness comes first!
Accepting reality is not stupidity but God given gift..
Demathew,  Muigai NJoroge,  Abraham etc we love u.....u have shown them away"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One big family of 2 wives and 7 kids or More!!
I beg you not to have no more third wives. Tell women outside there you have already enough wives so they help  you avoid immorality. Wear your rings."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A lot of bitter women projecting on Serah, she seems well endowed by Abraham and Maureen just the same. You women are more likely to accept the woman living elsewhere but in the same situation but not the ones who openly live together and love one another. It’s 2022, if you’re busy minding others choices who is minding yours?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Feel sorry for Sera. Hii ni Drama and when it unfolds it wount end well. Maureen wachana na bwana wawenyewe. Some women have no shame for real.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me just say the love i have for this wise sarah its something i admire i wont lie she is beautiful nd deserves better but anyway if she's happy  to be with father Abraham aving huyu Maureen who em i to judge but me staying under one roof with another woman (sidehen)of ma man tinie 💃 but em feeling so bad why lie Sarah you strong mama your shoe cnt fit me at all
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waaaa. Wonders never cease.  Ate kee!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen knew he was married and today she didn't know. She knew everything. Hoping Sera have peace of mind
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen spoke nothing but rubbish
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would like to see how Maureen behave when the third wife come will she accept it like serah? Let her make sure she come to tell us how happy she will be with the third wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My opinion to this is that, this guy is a womanizer how ever much he tries to pretend to love both,he doesn't have a good reason to have a second wife, im telling you he has not put a full stop on this! Surprisingly he mighty  be have some gals out there beside the two ladies! I hate everything here........"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something is not right. Oh God why all these eh. Women are in pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Abraham guy is Soo full of himself,he feels like he's on top of the world.. very mean n selfish guy..I feel for the 1st wife ..she doesn't look genuinely happy..this is a time bomb waiting to explode...wewe Maureen uliharibu boma ya wenyewe..Reke nemwo!!!Nkt!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,God created 1 man to 1 woman. It is not the will of God. We bless the Lord to bring light to them because He loves us all unconditionally.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is sooooo  smooth....damn...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Honestly hiii setup is a no for me. Woiii
q4sWUJxjc4g,Finally the version I understand..........wen I saw it in Kikuyu I was eager to know the story....... thanks lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,This dude has a sweet deal here. This is a business acquisition. He acquired two financially sound business partners with extra benefits. What is theirs is his and what is his is his?😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,He should be careful.when 2 women agree with your bullshit there must be something they are cooking.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is a big joke... He never respected the 1st wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The bible cleary calls the third party in a marriage ""death"" Soo.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's just weird how they laugh when cera explains how her man would sleep out.its like mockery and she was serious.sex and marriage comes with alot of jealousy
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He’s focus on building his empire at any cost, and it’s stupid of both women to believe that two will suffice. This story serves to confirm that the only bit of African Ancestry left in my blood and emotional temperament, is my black skin.  I wish ALL WESTERN born and raised black women could view this, it would help them understand the importance of staying clear of “African Men”, in their culture and country of origin they rule and are best served by their native women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You generalized a whole demographic coz of 3 people. Aren’t those African men there having such a good work ethic and earning top dollar to keep the family happy and taken care of. Look at the number of Nigerian, Ghanaian plus other African country doctors dominating healthcare systems all over the northern hemisphere up-to Australia. Anyway we also wish they married from home coz they get an opportunity to improve the lives of people back at home. We are glad to receive the remittances and expertise 🤷🏽‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am trying to put myself in sera’s shoes and they ain’t fitting ! We can’t be two of us ! Ngai !! Ans in the same house ! One would be in kamiti and the other one some where else  I don’t want to mention ! Aki wanawake tafteni pesa , learn to cater for yourselves and your kids such that if a son of a woman starts disrespecting you have your own way out"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is beautiful and younger than Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We can all see the pain Sera is trying to hide in her laughter. Let's be honest she was clearly forced to accept the other woman, and what's interesting to me , the guy never even once apologised to Sera for the infidelity and the lies. It's sad the way th
e two ladies overlooked how the guy was playing them both in the name of love. Check out pastor Gino 
Jennings on second wives"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man does not care about these women or his children. It’s all about him, and what he wants. He has both his mistress and his wife, all under one roof. He can move from one bedroom to the other, getting his needs met, but the two women have to wait for their turn.  Two beautiful women acting so desperate."
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah I know gino great preacher. Hard truth
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes she was forced to do it
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This interview weuh mtu unasweat🤣🤣🤣🤣Abraham ufisi tunaskia leo,,having atime out with another lady more than your wife,,kwera this man is just but aplayer"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn this was a hard interview 🤦‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu mwanaume is not good. Cera may good bless you. She has a pure heart for sure.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ukiona mwanamke amekubali bwanake aongeze Bibi wa pili bila tatizo, jua mwanaume ako na shida 😅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham : Maureen is beautiful..........me🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄she looks old
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah was whole ** package ** 📦???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ladies don't be lied. Abraham will still marry several other wives before he die.
The more he do business the more he shall meet more beautiful ladies.
Mundu niakindirie Gwake!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hata museme nini hakuna life hapo.. Mouren should leave Sarah's house .Aende atengeneze kwake akaribishe muke mwenza ndio akuje hapa kutuambia.Or these couples wako na weakness na wameona wanaeza tumia Mouren to cross the other side.Or this guy didn't marry out of love and now he has got it in Mouren?  Anyway
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wacera is hurt. And if I as a person say I don't like being called Sarah then father Abraham and Maureen keep calling her so, yet Lynn is making a very conscious effort to call her correctly is just speaking volumes about them. May her business blossom and open greater doors"
q4sWUJxjc4g,2wives are always evil they wait you to build the life from scratch with the man...then they come... they don't have anything like that kalife  ka humble beginning....I divorced my ex      and cursed   with pain  him for what he had done to me ...wah!aliisha to scratch. may God forgive me
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is always a dream for 99.9% men. They want their cake and ice cream and they will eat it too.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woi Sera stop being used mommie,,,,kaa kando n wao mourine should be in her house,,,,rem Hawa wanapendana,,wewe utaumia,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is no way to advice any family Abraham has no moral obligation to advice we can never normalice a sin
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After watching this ,I only asked my man if men can really love two n his response was as long u HV one hrt u can only love one person ,hapa kuna mtu anachezwa"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you are strong woman.Number 3,4 also coming 😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is no genuine love mmoja anavumikia tu coz for sure one cannot love two ppl ( wives)equally
q4sWUJxjc4g,..I look at serah n I see a woman in love who values her family..She accepted but it's clear she hasn't healed yet... Maureen is a good lady from the look of things...may heaven keep you and last your marriage 🙏🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said.my thought too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is living legend 😂😂!! He’s hitting 2 spots 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ukweli wa Mungu.. Aki siwezi kubali kukaa hapo 😡😡😡😡😡😡sina hiyo neema 🙆🙆🙆🙆Serah...you're a strong woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mimi siwezi lala kwa room yangu na bwana yangu Ako kwa next room with onother woman... Abraham separate this women for crying out loud..wacheni kujifanya ati extraordinary
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nobody, man or woman can thwart, change, interfere, delete, omit, disagree, eliminate God's idea of marriage. In the beginning God created Adam and Eve not ADAM and EVES! Let go back to the foundation of everything."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The pain that Sarah has is still fresh....she is doing all ths because of her kids....its not easy but she is trying if she can open up weeeeuh
q4sWUJxjc4g,father Abraham..wewe 🤣😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,We should head on to cera's page and support her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weuh I like how @Lynn Ngugi  ask questions  direct no shame and no fear....girl si I love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bullshit stop normalizing this shit it horrible wrong there is a lot of fish out there why someone husband 😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kabisa! Total Bullshit!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"🇿🇦🇿🇦 God bless you Sarah, your footsteps of love challenges are the same as my mother. She went through a lot & may God heals & bless her.  🇿🇦🇿🇦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am Kenyan in south Africa watching this nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am very jealous when it comes to love matters.. I can't share a man with another woman knowingly..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is just selfish&cruel.
This situationship started out as cheating no polygamy here.
Let him at least get separate houses for each!!
Maureen is a home wrecker period.
Serah you are sooooo pretty may your financial situation improve so you can make decisions you are content with."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn Ngugi u HV nailed it.best interview ever
q4sWUJxjc4g,This your story is changing every time now the caring maureen gave cerah ajob. This 2nd wives wanapenda kutafutia 1st job kazi.lol.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why show Maureen’s photos so much like this is hers alone, she’s another one behaving like Demathew’s 2nd wife
2nd wife’s are spoilers"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah's body language, her calmness is a numbing coping mechanism. There's codependency, she has lost herself at the expenses of those 2. Depression can easily creep on her.
Maureen, wants us to see her as kind and innocent which comes across as communal narcissism. (Wolf in a 🐑  outfit) The bestie  thing with Serah seems fake.
Abraham is a malignant narcissist. They hv put him on a pedestal. No balls to commit to either as long as he's getting what he wants.
Classic example of a toxic situationship, they all feeding off each other."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's so nasty!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Communal narcissism at its finest
q4sWUJxjc4g,You have described it so well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Spot on 🎯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So true, i got so off when he was asked about ruracio. He went round with no clear answer.  He is definitely a narcissistic,  i was still narrowing down who the type."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera  n Abraham's  marriage started by cohabitation.The foundation was wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bull. This man is just a selfish pig. Maureen has poor self esteem.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True.how do you even move in to another person's house??
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@catherine4043She’s beautiful and has brains why would she settle for this player.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Low self esteem..
This player is going to get a third one since now there's no thrill of cheating"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have so many questions on how receptive the first wife was, considering it was never discussed that they were open to dating other people from the start. The truth of the matter is, this is what is happening in the bigger percentage of couples in our African communities only that it is being done secretly. More power and respect to them for being fully open about it, makes everyone's life easier. 
An applause for Lynn for asking them the tough questions with no reservations but always keeping it respectful."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham why are you answering Sarah's question?ati let me help her
q4sWUJxjc4g,lynn ur professionalism on interviewing this blessed couple is at the helm good staff.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne what's the moral of the story?
q4sWUJxjc4g,However  beautiful this looks ! Deep inside   there's a  some jealous  but as the bible states  Moreen remains mpango  wa kando. Its only Sarah who's registered  in heaven as Abraham's. Wife. Moreen jipange for your own sefty.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Big time madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just love Moureen she's not a pretender, second wives come to destroy by force, but she's real, but again where is it written that only the first wives will enter ?you can be the first wife or even the only wife and still not enter heaven,ppl should stop judging Moureen ooh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love is territorial even God forbids us from adoring other gods.
q4sWUJxjc4g,White and black in hills😂😂?? look for abetter reason man! Otherwise you'll marry many other white in hills wako wengi sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's a TRIANGLE......One Soul hurting a day at a time....
....the man keeps hi-jacking moments in the conversation....controlling
Counseling should help them understand their positions."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you encouraged this, you could let him  fight his battles alone with his mistress..waaah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacera is much more prettier
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wee Maurine mbona ukiamuka time ya hug ya Cera 🙆🙆🙆🙆😕😕😕😕 you can still get your own man you are beautiful mummy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't touch my phone I don't touch your phone but steel got caught by his own baby 😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn👌
q4sWUJxjc4g,The parting shot of Serah has made me shed tears...she has never been lucky in life...even though she has said Abraham was the best thing that has ever happened in her life...Abraham still disappointed her..but sasa I guess aliona hana otherwise anyway ni life lazma maisha iendelee..it reaches a point where someone has to go with a flow like a dead fish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki watching this makes me wanna slap that man and the side chick! What do men really want? Cerah Your God will fight for you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who is Moreeeen 🤢🤢🤢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Can't believe I'm watching this kind of crap in they year 2022. No offence to Lynn and her team. My grandmother suffered for years and years in a polygamous marriage, why would we go back to this archaic way of thinking and doing things? Here we're just glorifying sin, period! See the way that guy feels accomplished, you can tell he's feeling like the village jogoo. Having his cake and eating it. Disgusting."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati this is Gods doing! BS!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@masoro19 i know! It's ""let's absolve ourselves from any wrong doing by throwing in the name of God""."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera stop saying bahati moja ulishinda ,that means you are just an unlucky ,low self esteem lady ,you don't love yourself"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This fool isn’t even married to any of them . Meeting parents is NOT marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,Heeey cute men with money lets find one for serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes this guy now will take advantage to love other women out there ad dump these 2
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't see myself watching this to the end,, i feel fr serah... This ain't right.. it's just ain't right."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is all about respect, understanding

Abraham,serah and moreen God bless your family"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a gentleman...satisfying them in everything
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Having keenly read and analysed all the comment here that have been given by a bigger margin by women I would say that most women are just , bitter , jealousy and idiot and none cannot compare to those two women."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It’s the fakeness for me 🙄 
They are not happy, Cera has been scammed! Anyway, to each their own. If she likes it, I love it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From what I can see/feel from this story, Abraham-Cerah's relationship is more of cordial and from a friend to friend view.(as in they are just friends/roommates)He likes her but isn't in love with her from a Romance POV.Maureen-Abraham is  more of an intimate romantic partner one that you are actually in love with and are attracted to but not from a friendship perspective.My views though."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its obvious from the body language.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yaani cera ni rafiki wa karibu.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True. Even the way he talks more of Maureen than Sera...
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@ndettothejuice3094 friends with benefits
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham there's nothing to emulate. Also stop talking about single mothers. They come about because of men like you. Cheating on their wives.....so stop talking like you're the solution to single mothers......
You cheated on your wife at her most vulnerable time when she had just given birth to your child. And that's the time that she needed you most......as her emotions were all over the place and she needed so so much love and help at that time. You on the other hand you were busy away from home with another woman. So please theres nothing beautiful about this.
If you had told your wife before hand that you wanted to get another woman 1st hand that's something else...You cheated. Period"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"truth be said , for sure abraham is real gentle man , that its very difficult and needs alot of couragefor man to disclose his other loving partner  to his legally married wife .......but this is hurting to serah...... despite all the unexpected desicion, definition of love serah that kind of lady that we all desire to have on our life..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After following up with the whole story, there's nothing to be proud of in this whole story. No matter how Serah will try to convince us that she's ok, she is not and I repeat it ""She's Not"" This Serah gal is still hurting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen O'Hara s so hurtless inhuman , with her big mouth. Am sure is she about to break another marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is written allover  her face.she is sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Victorine Okello Exactly dear!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very sad.
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I may be wrong but what if Serah is staying to "" punish "" them both. Yaani she's the kind wale wa you can't have your cake and eat it? I think the best punishment to them is her staying. Abraham and Maureen can't have an exclusive relationship. She knows if she leaves they win and this girl is intelligent....she won't let that happen. This girl is calling the shots. Abraham and Maureen can't dare cross her juu they know walimkosea and she's probably takin g advantage of their guilt."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just asking, am seeing Maureen has a ring and Serah doesn't if am not wrong. Who gave her that ring?Am just wondering?Abraham, would you clarify on that?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Poor Sarah!! I can't bring myself to watch this betrayal, absolutely nothing to learn from this. Please Lynne bring stories that can empower a young girl out there. 
I pray for my daughter, niece and sister to know her value as a woman. 
For"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't understand why she felt the need to cover this story and people can find it in other channels
q4sWUJxjc4g,True. I resonate with your sentiments.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True.....there is nothing to learn here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ama Serah na Maureen wanakulana😂🤝
Two women can’t just live together and share a man!🚮
Watamtokaaa!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story is super annoying.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pesa ni kitu ya maana sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have never wanted to comment on their story but today let me say my thought.. My grandfather had 2 wives and that polygamous marriage have brought pain even to us 2nd and 3rd generation.. I remember when my grandmother was almost dying and she said the pain she had experienced in that marriage should not be brought to anyone else..
All my uncles were warned on marrying 2nd wives..
It is sad that people get their soulmates when still in marriage.. I know Sarah still tear down up to today.. It is sad and wrong. Nothing fashionable about it.
My thinking!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am sitting here crying for my own mother,I am jogging my mind in my childhood and remember so many painful things my step mother caused."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True,i also experienced the pain that comes with polygamy  and as much as intentions  can be pure at first, it reaches  a point things change and you end up not understanding  anything anymore ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can relatw
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My great grandfather had 3 and he also said so and he specifically said no one should ever marry any wife from muranga and wote wenye who had dome so they were left miserable, old and without families now"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My TWO CENTS;  Ladies! let a man just love you with no reason, not based on your ability like how well you can  cook or clean for him, which was the case for serah. Abraham married her coz of her capabilities( cleaning n cooking) as opposed to love... 
2ndly, Maureen is a pretender and a liar. She knew very well that Abraham was married. For all those years that they dated how comes she never requested to visit Abraham's house to know where he lives yet himself he used to skip going back home to his family n spend at her house?????
Lastly, Abraham LOVES maureen, he is also very protective of her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moral of the story: as women we should learn to be as selfish as humanly possible. Lie if you have to. When caught, please twist it and look for a way to have your cake and eat it. Men keep teaching us daily. ✊🏾"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very well put
q4sWUJxjc4g,mwanamke die anajenga boma   even  in bible hakuna mwanamke ako na bwana wawili. l mean women should not do that
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very well.. cera is hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the only comment that has made sense to me 🤗i love this. You are so sensible. Me and you same watsapp group 🤣 women out here being so bitter thinking its their life,which for them it is 🤣🤣but you have one life to live as a woman,jibambe,stop placing your self esteem and worth on men 💁"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Okay, me as a human being, I have questions or concerns - men, how do you do this to someone - even just on empathy grounds????? This is not right and we shouldn't normalize this kind of madness."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True. This is selfishness, arrogance and taking advantage of others' vulnerability. So sad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kosokoso.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes Maureen it’s good to allow the father to be in the child’s life BUT it’s not right to encourage ladies to be second wives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kwa watakao vutwa macho Sarah ummoja wao
q4sWUJxjc4g,Open your eyes sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham ... will get a third one...he is really called to serve.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"#Lnnyngugi. 
If the husband came sat the 1st wife and explain to her the need for a second wife , that would show respect to the wife. But  they first commit adultery then Bibi anajua then anachukua the lady as ""2nd wife "" how do you feel when u know ""you betrayed Bibi yako .. the 2nd marriage is built on what....?
I just forget about it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah  prepare another room for the 3rd wife ..These kind of men can get upto 5 wives and many concubines..women let us respect ourselves  and be empowered financially  to avoid such nonsensical  situations ..would the Abraham guy accept another husband if serah brought one ?what is so special with Men ??nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don support polygamy......haki no
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mm hapo lazima tuchapane aki na sio uongo
q4sWUJxjc4g,Stupidity
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham officiate the marriage now.and don't dare to bring another one
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is the 3rd wheel ...this guy is in love with maureen look at how excited he is talking about his ordeal with maureen but he didnt feel confortable talking about serah. Women just know when to say enough is enough. Real father abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If husband is peaceful n happy with a second wife, let him be!
Better 2nd wife than a gacungwa hidden somewhere unknown!👌Live long as Abraham n ua queens"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Total infidelity
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah you are few among many... amazing, beautiful soul"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is love still a beautiful thing even while in polygamy......my heart is bleeding betrayal portrayed here......... desperation has led to this moureen felt like miaka zimesonga and she is in her 30's ,no husband no child and very soon time yake ya kukuwa kwa solo will expire....so she to fix herself in cerah's marriage to avoid depression of being single"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guys have reminded me of a southafrican series on showmax called Uthando nes’thembu . Not all poligamy marriages are disastrous.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This kind of EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE shared here is a rare find, treasure it Serah/Cera. It’s admirable. 
Abraham, wewe ni msmooth sana.
Maureen, ni life umechoose, live it tu best way you know how. 
All the best folks!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think its not possible to love 2 people at the same time, in this case Abraham loves Maureen coz if he loved serah he couldn't start dating Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen the daughter of Jebel and the cheating husband may God punish you for bringing more pain to cerah...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yaani a man can go ad sleep out even her own kid will question where he was it is shameful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I like the maturity in serah and she is beautiful...i hope that she will heal soon because one thing I know about love is that,love is jealous..may the will of God happen to serah,s life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,And nobody is talking about Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceera she's very beautiful and humble 🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,I actually feel the betrayal. I feel hurt on Serah's behalf
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is a manipulator and Maureen is a home breaker - no matter how she try to clean it up
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my next life , i want to be a man 😂😅😅 they can get away with almost anything 😇"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah you are one in a million lady,stay that way all the way dear...that family is really blessed"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel like Abraham didn't tell Maureen he had a family because he didn't want to loose her but was quick to tell Sara the truth because he didn't care if she got angry and left
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree with your observation. I think he secretly wished Ceera would go. But she surprised him by staying, and he became polygamous. He didn’t even have two houses, because he had planned for Ceera to leave and Maureen moves in."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am thinking loud here..two questions
1. If Maureen was the first wife, would she welcome serah? 
2. Would Abraham looked for a sevond wife is Maureen was the first wife?
This is betrayal big time."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@jennifermcwhortet7934 exactly. I feel Abraham has been self-centered
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think I saw somewhere the guy started having the affair with Maureen after fighting with Sera, so ni ukweli what you are saying so sad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@jennifermcwhortet7934 what if he takes a third one?  Would maureen accept.?
He is breaking God's commandments."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who would grolify her groly being given to another woman,hapa kuna mtu hapendwi but she has to vumilia tu n pretend that all is well, aaaaai women owns n owns it all n can not even share the love with even the mother of the husband nowonder the inlaws sagas,am I making sense"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera ad moreen it's okay for now, but the third one will come very soon, , the way abraham did to you sera, must do to moreen, wait you will see"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu Abraham n fisi tu Wana hurt Sera even if she won't say it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kudos Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wud hate to live a lie esp. In love matters,men like Mwangi don have love,u can't love 2 pple at the same tym & at the same level,he is more of the potential in the two ladies & the benefits,men can be very selfish,watch out 4 the series of ""Sister wives"", they wer 4 of tem bt only one remains todate,ope the two wives aren't sitting on a time bomb,set to blow off 1dy but tym will tell."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Betrayal.Betrayal plane and simple very very sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,I thought the brown one is 1st wife.She came to soil the happiness of cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So what am learning from this story,,we should be 2in one..but for me I disagree..I can't share not in my eyes..in the same house 🤔😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ningechoma iyo nyumba na magari zote,na nipotee na watoto,juu amesema the guy loves his kids..ningeenda nao hangewahi waona"
q4sWUJxjc4g,SARAH!!!!!!! I just want to hug her. The pain in her eyes. The look of betrayal. The questions in her mind!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Imagine 🙄she's in pain, I'm sure she didn't want to leave because of her children"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree
q4sWUJxjc4g,She said she's cerrah
q4sWUJxjc4g,IT'S YOU WITH PAIN. AS FOR HER SHE IS LIVING HER LIFE. IF IT CAN'T WORK FOR YOU STOP PAINTING A WRONG IMAGE
q4sWUJxjc4g,if  Sarah have pain hangepata  mtoi mwingine. she is a women with big heart .yeye ako sawa
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter how we paint this it is immorality!
How do you tell us that you saw moureen very beautiful yet you had Serah as your wife"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yani Kuna Watu God Made Them To Have Two Ribs. The Flesh of My Flesh N Bone of My Bone,,, Implies To Two People. It Is Written When Two People Lie Together,, They Get Heat. Nway,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mini naona ataoa Tena WA Tatu he is very young alafu anakaa swag za diamond
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just can't beleive he told Cera""Cera, si you know"" woiyee what does that meant. Hana Ata words za kumwambia. But Maureen won his heart. 😭Pray for healing for Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I believe I am human and can't understand why, how. There is something called tolerance and has to stick around and can't do anything about it.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My heart goes to serah,so sad,Abraham God is the judge"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel so bad for serah i hope she will be able to stand on her own one day and find peace
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn my superhero with now marriage is working with two wifes in Kenya
q4sWUJxjc4g,If it was that serah was not provided everything as in needs ad satisfactory there could be a big fight here.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is in pain and there is no need of lying,,she loves the guy so much and that's why she's not leaving,I would advise her to just go and leave them two this dude loves Maureen,,, period!!!!! ,,This ladies are worshipping this guy,,,,,I just pity Sarah,,kwangu I will never share my man with anyone"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sorry to say  this but once u get married that's when u will realize u never married the love of your life 🥰hugs serah u look emotionally damaged
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamy is not a walk in the path. I come from 1. My friend one person has to  forsake some things for the sake of peace and marriage.
Give this marriage time and Serah you will regret ever allowing ""Peninah"" in your house. 
Anyway that's their bone to chew but there's nothing beautiful about this show today."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But what worked here is cash yaani  being well of
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah  aki wewe ni Sara wa Bible  kabisa,hii patience  nayo mimi sina,kaa kusikia tu kuna kampango  mahali kananitoga wazimu,ni hii ya mtu kuja kuhamia  kwa nyumba  yako,????I salute  u  kamama, jipee nguvu ,I believe  God will  fight for u,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreen respect serah most ad do good  to her ad her kids for you to be bleesed you interupted someone's family
q4sWUJxjc4g,As for me to he honest l cant have a co wife it is better l just live the man no never it will never happen am a very jealous person 😅😅😅
q4sWUJxjc4g,How can I unsee this aaah Naaah No😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also feel bad for women that are not okay but they have to be okay even when it means being disrespected..if truly asked,no woman wants to be a second wife to anyone.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This Maureen woman is just a homewrecker.lets not beat around the bush.She had all the right to put Abraham off especially after learning they had a baby.My heart goes to Serah I hope she is healed😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Beauriful family indeed 🥰 whom am I to judge. To those opposing polygamy your men are out there with multiple sidechics   better this Abraham guy whose just straight forward and knows what he wants 😉
q4sWUJxjc4g,"🇿🇦🇿🇦 I'm coming from this nonsensical polygamy family for which on behalf of my practical experience I won't encourage any man to polygamy family because is a nonsense out of a toilet. I did experience  hate, jealous, evil behavior & other more dramatic things in polygamy family & I swear not me join polygamy is hell evil for which I did experience & I wish 1 day our beautiful 🌺Lynn🌺 can challenge a topic against polygamy & hope the world will learn a lot 🇿🇦🇿🇦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I'd rather a polygamous man than a cheating monogamous man!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is totally wrong and from the look of things serah is not happy ,coz if it was something genuine Abraham could have told serah about his relationship with Maureen before she could find out herself plus the question is if Abraham says that serah has never wronged him and she's been a good woman then why go ahead and  marry another woman and to make matters worse bring her to your house with a woman you've been married to for 8 years ,this is so hurting and its not right ...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Have been in such a situation thank God it ended and it doesn't feel right...As the first wife,i didn't have an option but to accept what my hubby had decided(having another woman) i didn't want t lose what i have created for years with him for a new comer...it's never 💯,never easy at all kwanza mkiwa pamoja watatu,deep down it hurts...but i thank God i prayed sana na mrembo akajitoa,i prayed for her own husband...Serah i feel you kabisaa,inauma but hauna otherwise...
Good luck"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eeh you did the right thing...imagine this setup is not God's will for any of His daughters. Maureen will leave sooner or later. Serah has to just pray always.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thanks Sylvia for sharing your story. Glad it has a happy ending. Baraka tele
q4sWUJxjc4g,It seems that this man is taking advantage of Maureen because she is hand working he don’t have love for her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Prayer works
Mungu ampe maureen  mme wake,the same way Serah alipewa Abraham...it's never real,i can confess"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@cwambutura3307 , he loves Maureen but his love for Sara died!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is how it will end. Cerah will move out. And Abraham will no longer find contentment in Maureen and that's where Carol and Lucy will come in. And Maureen will get the medicine of her own serving. Cerah once u move out, come here we will sort u our financially to live a better life. 
Lastly, the 3 of you should know the impact this will have on your children. You have ganged up to destroy their lives. It's gon get messed up. You better make better choices asap."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes yes yes
q4sWUJxjc4g,Iseeeee
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The man was so so unfair
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man!! Serah girl! I'm praying for you..,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,My thoughts is as long they respect each other may God bless them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's easy to fool the eyes but it is hard to fool the heart,,,don't say u love both coz ur lying to us,u love one and u like the other."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Online-in-laws please embrace Maureen, I'm not in the same position but the oil has spilled already , Cera has opened the door for her, i love their relationship"
q4sWUJxjc4g,huyu ni abraham wa ukweli wa bibilia wee sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wawa just Cera Sayed she have never won anything till when she met Abraham my tears rolled,hece she din't anaged to finish the statement inqots after Iwon moreen took him from me Wawa Cera mungu atakupa mwongozo dhabiti.hugs"
q4sWUJxjc4g,After 10yrs walete tena ndio utajua Ukweli wao
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my considered opinion, Sera is just in it because she's in too deep and there's no going back. Because personally, I'd feel like I'm being boxed out of my marriage. Eight years were enough for him to be with another person??? I pray that this union doesn't end in premium tears for Sera especially. ☕😅"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"But this doesn't make sense cox of a kid , this man needed sex outside his marriage, he could have  supported moreen with the kid separately ad moreen could had got married to another man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel like crying....I was dating someone's hubby but nimeacha waaah this hits so deep,, serah pole kamum ,,,you deserve much better 😔😔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😅😅😅what if ni wako ako na kamtu😂😂😂wear that shoes but iris what iris
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@sharyanachannel inaumaaa wueh! Now I know better
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love your honesty. Glad you saw the light and realized it’s wrong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah run for  you're life..mungu hakufungue macho.
q4sWUJxjc4g,😳😳😳😳😳
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People can share food but not a husband mounreen look for your husband 
Cera has no choice but to maintain her husband 
Go away woman destroyer"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sina comment. Let me support serahs business
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have listened to a couple interviews on this family which was all good, however, Lynn you nailed it. We got way much more than ever before. Thank you for an excellent interview"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is wrong waache kufanya betraying sera was a good thing no! We shouldn't be glorifying sin this is wrong akh I feel sorry for sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Surely,  Serah is still in pain u can see. She just accepted knowing how much her husband was involved with Moreen and probably she also had a kid with him and also deeply loves the man. BUT MEN.....🤔🤭🤔👋👋👋👋"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Interesting 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,This family 👪 is so beautiful. Our grandparents used to marry many wives and all respected each other and loved each other. May God bless you 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is a resemblance, they look together"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is beautiful in ad out  ad she is young in age  maureen was rushing because of over age
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waoh Lynn, well done for the interview it came out differently from the rest that I have watched! keep soaring!! Kundos to thaeAbrahams empire be happy in yourselves don't listen to people... do what makes you happy......"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is insane, myself I cant as long as I have my own career, naweza watching hio marriage.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wa achia hio marriage.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"And watching the man's body language and all, he loves Moreen more but needs Cerah as a family woman or mother"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"For the first time LNS has bored me,,wat impact does this story bring to the audience,,,my beutiful gal Lyn umensinya Sana leo,Hui no story gani sass😏😏😏😏😏wee lyn ndukanacokere ringi niwaigua!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow,this is beautiful ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I surely don't agree with this deception its not the kingdom way but thats my opinion serah you are paining I can tell you
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is marriage a must?,mtu akikudharau na akuletee make mwenza si you can leave them ,kwani, is he your God that you can't do without him.Mapenzi ya pesa ndio inaleta madharau ya aina hii  njuu wife hana say."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The more I listen I am more than convinced Cerah is not happy about this whole arrangement. She even finds out about the affair on her own.. She's probably staying for her kids...I hope she leaves. Women can't share a man freely like that. The man clearly knows how to manipulate these 2...A real narcissist...(not to hate)
q4sWUJxjc4g,And when  she discussed it with him he tried to gaslight her at first. When she stuck to the subject he was surprised and then came through to confess. He is a piece of work!
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@neemaadam I know... That is the highest form of immaturity..you catch me in wrong and I turn it around. No taking responsibility whatsoever. He also seems like an entitled little man with such a low esteem and very insecure..he has to get whatever he wants at all costs and feeds off these women's submission..so against this whole arrangement!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Sarah . This is so annoying……
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham married his youthful wife serah .....then met the love of his life Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Full of 💕💕💕 serah is beautiful and a strong woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Toxic! Toxicity masked in smiles.  Cerah is sad in the inside and I hope she's there organizing her finances to leave. She is definitely bruised and deep inside she has regrets. But she has to say what they want to hear. The man has a ego thing that makes him feel like he is winning. Unfortunately he can't be helped coz he doesn't see it as an issue.  For the second wife, no words. You have to be very special to hurt someone in their home for the rest of their lives and mask it with a smile. Dirty."
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one could have put  it better than you have done it baby gal
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯👏👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dirty and filthy! And considering that she is less beautiful....oops!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some women have a golden heart, Sarah omg.Maureen was loved because of business favors. Both ladies are beautiful 😍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please serah give your heart coz itanisaidia when i get my husband cheating on me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Seraph is the more beautiful of the two.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is very selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A person loves one person at a time.
Deep down Abraham there is the one he loves. But I hope Serah will continue standing this.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am wondering after this love love thing...who will he sleep with tonight????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This story is just too painful to watch, Serah should be honest about how she feels and stop trying to explain that she is okay with the whole arrangement, Abraham is just too full of himself he wants to have a cake and eat it. I would rather sleep on the street with my kids than tolerate such nonsense. Feeling pissed off.... lets not glorify immorality..Period.Lynn, you are the best I don't think there is a journalist who knows how to bring out a story like you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So bad this man did bad indeed and for those who move in to married men think twice if it were you , how could you feel, it is unfair"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Christians are each others worst enemies. We crucify each other using the Bible. So it's okay for a man to cheat on his wife in secret bora asishikwe rather than bring your sins to light,  ask for forgiveness and deal with the consequences. Abraham is a real man. He's made mistakes,  he recognizes his mistakes,  has acknowledged them and is been responsible for the consequences. What else do you guys want? So if example Maureen left today, does that erase the sin? How about that baby? Sometimes we want to act as saints behind the keyboard but behind the scenes we are something else . I am not for polygamy but it's how people react like saints out here. I hate hypocrisy more than polygamy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is shameful, sometimes  there will be much expenses , energy and less trust. They smile outside but inside there is hidden dashes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen respect cera always
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's okay with Muslims now wait for the third one lol
q4sWUJxjc4g,Surprised polygamous or polygamous relationships still popular when we think it should be phasing away.
q4sWUJxjc4g,A man having his cake and eating it. But for how long?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Damn!!!! Cerah is cuuuuuute!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah went thru so much brokenness and she is still not ok!! This man also seems like a covert narcissist. He has learned his way with words even how he is answering the questions its cringe worthy. Maureen was also sweet talked into this she was also hurt and when she said "" but he has a way with words blah blah blah"" that was it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Congratulations Abraham men are out there pretending  and they have wives and children out there
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nani anataka nimsaidie mzee wake 😂😂😂nitakaa kwa line yangu
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love your interviewing skills
q4sWUJxjc4g,Didn't know Sara cried the last part😭😭I have really shed tears..Sarah be strong and pray for strength
q4sWUJxjc4g,This what Kenyans will say Weuh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are always crying cz your husband is never in the house ako na side chic na uko huku ukitusi and judging watu wamechoose peace of mind....
q4sWUJxjc4g,The ladies look like sisters I don't understand what this man was looking for in another woman woi pole Serah...Abraham has done you wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,AWaaaah this is just beautiful and the ladies are full of so much wisdom and so is Abraham. Bless them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Show me the little girl whose dream is to be in a polygamous marriage 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Really  Gg , there is none"
q4sWUJxjc4g,None at all she looks very betrayed
q4sWUJxjc4g,I hope Sarah finds a husband one day
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its written in your face Sarah....one day u will free your heart and find true happiness and peace. Your beauty and calm composure is admirable. A serious hubby would have nurtured that. God bless u.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@agathamunyao3475 Amen 💕💕🙏🏼
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love this family soo Much. May God give them peace always.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weeuuhhh.....
Ill always chose myself no matter what... I cant entertain that nonsense... This man is so selfish. Anyway have learnt to let pple live there life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Everyone will throw stones but don't let people judge you,,l wish you nothing happiness n respect n God protect Abrahams family.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Eeeeh Lynn, don't I just love your questions! Great work"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So, according Maureen's explanation...
After she knew there was a wife even though she felt really guilty, she still continued to have coffee dates with Abraham, went ahead to sleep with the guy & had a baby(still feeling guilty)... Come on, we ain't that stupid... she(Maureen) should just say she enjoyed the ride of making Sera's life miserable(& by miserable I mean - if Sera didn't accept Maureen, Abraham would have left Sera for her). After all, hakuna mahali tutampeleka.🤷‍♀️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True..she got guts
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Basi bahaa arudie mamake mueni wawe wawili na Diana 🙄🙄🙄... This is nonsense i will never try this shit and am even a Muslim it's aloud in my religion na siwezi hata robo sekunde uke wenza my foot nijikute🙄🙄to me it's either uniache or umuache period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a story I've been waiting for so long. Serah seems not to be happy. Her quietness doesn't seem normal or genuine. I think for her is the case of kupiga hesabu. You think of what you will lose when you walk out after struggling na machama unaamua tu mbanane hapo hapo. Wacoast mpo???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera was ur blessing man, u will lost everything in a twinkle of an eye 👀 and ur so called Maureen  will be nowhere to be found"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen u knew very well this man is married yyyyy did bore a kid with him . Stop justifying yourself seraph had no choice
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think Abraham should respect cera more because she's the one behind the peace we're seeing and the reason they have a story to tell today,,, she could have moved out or fought,,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"How are you going to raise your gals in such a situation 💔💔💔don't come here crying when they start sharing husband, depressed,or abusing drugs due to trauma.as for Cera jipange mama it's all over on Abraham and moureens face they connect really well and in love.we are here we gonna support you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""I love you both "".🙄🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If a man has 1 woman or 2 women outside his marriage and has a child/ children and the wife doesn't know 
What is that?
Is that polygamy? 
What do we call such a relationship??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Huyu jamaa alichukuwa 2nd wife coz of bizz sio kitu ingine, biashara was the bridge but wakachoma ikawa affair."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men will never get satisfied with one woman
q4sWUJxjc4g,sanitizing adultery.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Social media is a strong influencer.  May the comments made by individuals airing their views not harm or influence this family negatively.   It is their choice and they seem happy.   They are a hard working family.  Wish them everything good.  May the unity last a lifetime.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The actual couple is actually matching clothes guys,hata viatu...Can't y'all see,???
Serah baby 😭😭😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is going to cheat again because he has no principles, because even if Maureen didn’t sleep with someone else’s husband especially after knowing he was married. That boy would have found someone else"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham has said it we'll look at the speck in your eyes  before throwing stones
q4sWUJxjc4g,But you talk about Maureen so much then Sarah please stop I’m saying Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think this is the perfect way for this man,,, he made good decisions, than  having mpango ya kando"
q4sWUJxjc4g,THE BODY LANGUAGE ON SERA AS THE HUBBY EXPLAINS HOW HE STARTED CHEATING. SERA IS HURTING THE BETRAYAL IS REAL!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Things happen for a reason this interviews are happening for a reason for this family and God knows everything about each of them so life goes on..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you mama for empowering me
I will do the same to my daughter!
Serah you have everything but you deserve gold baby girl
You deserve so much better"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeh...I don't know what to say.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well done Lynn! You are great at what you do. Your questioning skill is on point-
q4sWUJxjc4g,This one no comment 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐
q4sWUJxjc4g,Our gal Lynn best interviewer I know.....leaving all stones unturned n from this interview selah is hurt!
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is manipulative
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ngugi share a video in peris mbuthia story about rose.. kindly
q4sWUJxjc4g,i think the person who should have respected herself was sera...my God if i ever see my daughter in such a circus woi ni mungu tu atanisaidia 😂😂😂😂😂anaweza rudisha school fees yote nisha wahi tumia...ngai wakwa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well done Serah and Maureen  you are the best  ladies ever God bless you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oh God Lynn did you have to do this 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is definitely hurting,and complying..she was definitely caught off guard and one day she gonna break the chains."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham and Maureen took advantage of Cera/Serah. Nothing noble in this.
Wish you healing Cera."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is not too late to look for your own husband Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is emotional abuse. He knows these women are not strong enough to leave, therefore he uses that to his advantage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What a manipulative son of pharaoh 😳🥲. He cheats, admits it, then gives the wife an ultimatum 🥲. Smart for the wife to stay for her kids but seriously lady where is your dignity?? 🥲🥲🥲"
q4sWUJxjc4g,mbona Maureen and Abraham wameangaliana serah akisema what she do it's like they discuss her nkt😢😢😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes let's talk about Christianity,. please  let's stop being hypocrites  men out there have hidden wives, concubine's, including pastors, bishops, so guys this family has come out to speak their truth, isn't it better than  faking? Now this one answer it yourselves. Peace out!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Oh pls. If it was the other way around. Sarah introducing Abraham to another man he would have been gone in a heart beat. He would never entertain the idea of them living together. 

The only one benefiting from this so called relationship is Abraham and Maureen who went from a side chick to a house wife."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Eyy first of all thanks Lynn i mean you are the best ...and to Abraham, Serah and Maureen thats so beautiful of you..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But let tell Abraham Sarah is to beautiful ☺️

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm not of the two wives culture so during the meeting of the two wives, this husband is secretly feeling like the 'COCK OF THE WALK' (proud) as the saying goes here in Jamaica. Marriage trap, who it trap???? ""WOMEN!!! Wish women would stop giving men so much power and stop walking on their self esteem. 
Cerah is not 100% there. I'm watching body language. Her hands are always closed. 
For the husband,  no words for him. Second wife is being used for wealth building."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wah LN almost 500k
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah doesn't seem ok....her face can tell it all.... anyways all the best to her

q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is so full of himself..my heart goes out to Serah.wait n see how God will come through for you.hugs baby girl.you are destined for greatness
q4sWUJxjc4g,He's also controlling.. Notice how he cuts serah short to answer on her behalf? Also it's evident they've reduced her to nothing.. Notice her self-esteem is 0
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well spoken Abraham God bless the  family

q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeh
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have seen soo many polygamous family but to say the truth very few end up well
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham to me looks like that guy chauvinist akisema amesema.n nothing you can do about it.he sounds like he made a mistake with cerah.cerah I pray you start loving yourself more
q4sWUJxjc4g,How now? Abomination! You can never love and satisfy both. Lust it is from him.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Afro cinema continues shortly...i feel for Cerah,she's suffering from inside but she cant show it because she knows her husband is in love..Maureen,the audacity!!!and you think you will be happily married😢..About the husband stop mentioning Christ on prostitution😂😂.this my opinion,halloooo"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Minute 43.14 says it all!!!  That right there speaks volumes All this other justification is pure BS. So its either his way or the highway.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just love Sarah,😘😘 you're blessed mama... Maureen you're a destroyer😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ile jicho Serah anapea Abraham 👀😂😂😂, she stayed and accepted hana otherwise Abraham  definitely love the second wife, alafu so Abraham and Maureen ni bread winners wuueehh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The women look alike
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think love is for two people, when the third person come in it becomes something else. Hapa hakuna love, hii ni kuvumiliana tu na kulea watoto"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love is jealous.......Whatever it is Sera needs to walk out of this marriage ...sadly this is what happens when a mna knows you love them so much and you can't do anything without them ....as for me and my heart I can't stoop this low
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is brave & selfish at the same time,He liked Serah because she could do something for him eg clean the house, kumuingiza Chama etc, He liked Maureen coz she could favor him in the business etc, He easily get attracted to women who can work. Possibly he can marry and marry and marry.Lakini God bless them"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Felt like I was seated on a hot seat through out the interview,Gai! Lynn,your hard questions 🤭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen you will never get peace for the rest of your life by destroying this good family can you get your own husband and get out of serahs marriage…may GOd never give you peace forever and ever……the damage you have brought to seraph you will never be forgiven in Jesus name it will also be done to you and it be more and more painful Maureen .that is not love this guy want to use you because of his own Bussiness and selfishness….
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The power of money 🤑.. the 1st one is much stronger than the 2nd one but the truth here's clout chasing... Very soon the truth shall be prevailed..if I was the husband, wangeishi kando kando.. but for now... May leave the best life.. good luck"

q4sWUJxjc4g,May they live to prosper.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In African setting before the white man came with his ""sacred"" book and taught us that we're primitive, polygamy wasn't frowned upon. Infact if you observe closely, man is by nature polygamous and is only restricted by laws that come with consequences. 
Way back we had no destitute children... now men have to hide or abandon their other kids who end up suffering. 
I applaud this family for doing it right, having respect and supporting each other... and also nurturing their kids without discrimination. 
All the best Abraham's Empire!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All this is not adding up.. One is not happy.. at it's so obvious...Gal Love you , you deserve better.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sometimes you have to agree not because you like it but because there's no other option 😥.
q4sWUJxjc4g,There is always an option. The problem is that most of us women are conditioned to believe there is no option.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This must be so hard for Sera,, especially the fact that they financially grew together,  It wasn't an option to just step out remembering that investment yake pia iko apo. Sera may God give you strength to always endure whatever comes your way"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"She might be strong Infront of us but maybe she hurts and leaving was just not an option,,, you know we never know what happens behind closed doors"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Leo wameongea ukweli kabisaa it's not easy it's by the grace.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As a Christian polygamy no, it's not good, in the case of maureen she came in between married couples, who have become one, so where is her place... Such ladies of maureen type are rapidly increasing number of broken homes, or rather making the other woman not to break silence, and the man in the first place is a cheat not satisfied with his wife and beautiful kids."
q4sWUJxjc4g,God what kind of life is this😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,That's why we r warned of broke men u grow up financially and then he finds his type😭🥺

Love is naturally jealous so these women aren't they jealous 🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly,this is a God working Miracle."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is a home wrecker
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the third time I have watched this family and weeuh ..I cnt 🤦🏼‍♀️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati coffee dates🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,The  most painful part is this man is liking on Maureen alot ata hana aibu akisifu  no.2 in public and this shows  many are times Sarah is hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,sorry for Sarah 😢 she was betrayed .... so sad 😢😢
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is sooo wrong at all levels but who are we to judge? May God be the judge for Sarah and give her real truth......hapa alipangwa kupangwa .....wah!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is as simple as Maureen had sex with a married man ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn ulifika kwa cerah lini?.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I love you like a sister and always pray you get a good husband  coz of your clean heart ❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Huyu jamaa anakataa player tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You can convince me that Sarah is okay with this arrangement, Abraham you did your wife wrong."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think when commenting about children each should say she has 4 kids because now they are one happy marriage  Ibrahim's empire   that's my opinion
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some people have their own problems in their houses and instead of dealing with them wako hapa criticizing people who are happy in their marriage
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Of all the interviews they have been done about this empire  ...this I will give it 10/10 ...   Lynn  you are just a vibe yaani the whole episode  it's full of love and wisdom!  .... there's love, respect and cooperation  in this empire and they are blessed  their choices are highly respected and more grace in their home 😘  wooow  .... congratulations Abraham  ✋"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Any normal functioning human being must be jealous, there's no loving two women ,and it's start with being promiscuous in marriage let me leave it at that point."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah...Mimi umenishinda ...Siwesi kubali hata na dawa..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Right from the coverpage of this story Ceera's face doesnt look like a happy face...it speaks of agony, affliction,anguish,misery, sufferance, suffering,torment,torture,distress,loss of self, disconnection, betrayal, deepest pain one could ever get to for them to go numb...she is in too deep that she doesn't even realise what is going on...but one thing for sure, nothing lasts forever and she will get up from this nightmare.
Dear Ceera,
I hope you read this one day...you are marvelous and you deserve better. My heart goes out to you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn am a woman and always prefer my husband to marry another wife than kuhanya.  Another thing is that women are many and if someone can take good care of 2 wives why not. Please we should not judge them badly. Let us support and pray for them. Muhimu nikuheshimia Serah and Maureen. Ishini kwa amani ❤❤❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,Going round doing interviews to justify this union in today’s  society. This mubaba will still cheat on them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you know, you know!... The lady said she's called Cera and does not like when called Sara...but Moreen and husband are is calling her Sara..that in its own has a lot to say.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What I see here is..Cera has set the peace ground of which 3 are walking on..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow, unbelievable!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I couldn't finish the whole interview,see this woman serah emotional like this is disgusting 🥺😩😩"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not happy at all I can see that in her face.. Her body language too... 😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,What's God's doing?one man one woman . period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah is more beautiful than Morine..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The more reason I even wanted to be a lawyer just to deal with this ppl called second wives, she's lucky is our gal Lynn asking questions because she always treats all her guests with equall measure of respect but today I've wished we the audience could have had the chance to ask Maureen questions, this ppl make our dads love be subsided towards us his first children."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The face of Sera says it all.  Too many unspoken words
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah just found herself in a fix and had no option but to accept..it seems the guy loves maureen more than serah...stuck at the place where serah said ""i knew maureen was not going anywhere""..waah!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Pliz don't judge Maureen,, as the hubby has said many of those judging are in the same setup,, mnafichwa kama bangi. All of them have pure hearts."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am a Muslim and in Islam is allowed upto 4 wives. Yes it's not easy especially for the first wife bt with time she'll cope.  It's better a man to marry another wife than doing prostitution.  Am a married woman and what i can tell Serah and Maureen is please take good care of yourselves and husband. So longer as you are happy that's enough 
May ALLAH Bless you abundantly.  Musiskize watu coz people will always talk ill"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is obvious he didn’t love Sarah. Maureen is very guilty but pretending to be sweet
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah our sister  something  inside so strong ,your eyes girl tells it all do what is best for you...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hugs to Serah,you are beautiful good hearted lady .hope you not hurting in silence.i feel this will not last and one day Maureen will move out to her own house."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The comments i am seeing here shows a lot of scientism  mostly driven by the Christian beliefs and others just by the fact that the missionaries did a great job turning us into mirrors of their thread bare cultures, We think we re them with no knowledge of our recent pst and how our societies functioned. The to parent family is now what we think is us.
According to the Ethnographic Atlas by George P. Murdock, the study of 1,231 societies from around the world noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygamy; 588 had more frequent polygamy; and 4 had polyandry.
This means the world was always  polygamous but because christians brainwashed us and we now think we are more european than they are. we act shocked that this can actually work. Well it works and it is natures/Gods intention.
Monogamy was a Greko Roman legistation that came out of necessity to streamline the growing Urban nature of their society. These laws then seeped into Christianity because the Roman empire bacame the custodian of the faith. A thousand and more years later after subjugating europe with these values Colonialism spread it. 
Plygamy is natural. the only hinderance is our social constriction...we view something only 100 years ago our fpreparents did naturally and peacefully"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham had many sons?
q4sWUJxjc4g,We wish them God's blessing s
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sasa huyu… Abraham is very disrespectful towards Serah. Why is he referring to her that way?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Only God can understand them
q4sWUJxjc4g,These guys who speak a lot of English🙄 Ati by and by..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"lynn and to the abraham family am happy for the family,let pple not burry their head watu wako na mipango ya kando nje ni vile its not officiated .ni mara ngapi tumeona matanga ikiturn chaos watoto wengine wakitokea? i got a wife and a baby mama  ,i could give everything tukae pamoja bt since it aint possible i respect the abraham empire sana.....ni bibi wengi wako home bwana zao wako na familia zingine na hawajui...to those judging harshly shame on u all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To cope with the whole situation and keep her husband with her, she decided to accept and adapt to this illegitimate affair. I don't know how sustainable it is...wueeh! She literally handed her husband over to the 2nd woman. Mind blowing that she didn't fight for him 🤯. If I was the man, I would question alot 🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hands down for Lynn . You bring out the good bad and ugly on the table in the most professional manner. Abraham and Maureen, you have emotionally tortured this woman into submission. Sarah open your eyes, Abraham doesn’t love you, that boat sailed. These two just look down on you and you can see it in their faces."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even at his closing speech, he focused on Maureen 95% of the time and only gave Serah glances. My goodness!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@nursemaggie2321 true sad part Sarah looks at him for acknowledgment and sympathy, he can barely look at her. He has no love for her at all. Her words and body language are not in sync. The dynamics of the whole conversation she has no say she just echoes what they say."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@Anniesoft1 She even said she usually speaks up about being ""sidelined."" I guess that slip out her mouth."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, I hope when your turn comes, you will welcome his concubine to your house to show cheating is good and easy.  Remember your turn is coming."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly and the way Sera is beautiful she should just leave this man ....To you Maureen shame on you
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mo'  the new advocate of 2nd wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,This will end in premier tears beacuse I can never change Jehovahs nature
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can never agree with I love them all how many hearts does he have? there's nothing here like criticism God it's until death do us part, second wives are are that death because they come kill that first love, by experience I'm from a polygamous home,let me tell u the truth Lynn first wives vumilia alot  sanasana introverts kama Serah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves maureen from all his interviews.His worry was not him loose maureen and not cera though cera ako chonjo.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham stayed  with Cera for 6years later he fell in love with Maureen. If today Cera falls in love with someone would Abraham allow her to love the other person and raise the children with other man as these two ladies are doing? If not he is selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham had many sons..... Please don’t name your sons Abraham because there’s power in a name. Jokes aside, this is nuts. A young man, behaving like my late grandfather who had 5 wives in the 1920s. And 2 beautiful, self accomplished, young women, sharing a man, and living in this brothel-like setting. Abraham’s harlem is the appropriate name for this charade, not Abraham’s empire."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nijikute !!! Nonsense 🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is madness😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,They are all too young let's see 10 yrs what we'll be having
q4sWUJxjc4g,Men are lucky! This is the highest form of betrayal!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera is so beautiful both physically and emotionally
She's kind,I love her skin colour"
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,True and moreen looks old than them
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@jacklinegmail643 sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Shes a strong woman ...she may not be good in business like Maureen but shes a homemaker, reliable and dependable..This is a woman with such a biiiig heart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Indeed she is so beautiful.  Her skin tone is great.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is very wrong. Yes it’s your life but it’s still wrong and ungodly. You should have disconnected yourself immediately Maureen when you heard that this Abraham is married. You Abraham are also a lustful man, deceitful and very manipulative, and now you’re trying to cover up your sinful lustful nature by making yourself appear as if you’re honest, loving and better than other men who cheat on their wives whereas you’re exactly the same. You deeply disrespected, dishounered and hurt your wife Sarah. She only agreed to this and played along because she was scared to leave you and you probably didn’t give her any choice. You probably made her feel as if she’d be nothing without you. You come across as someone whose very arrogant and selfish in a very subtle way. The only thing and person you care about is yourself. Now that everything is out in the open you’re beating yourself in the chest that you’re better than those that cheat secretly. You’re not! Sarah is not happy and deep down she hasn’t accepted this situation. She feels humiliated and exposed. You’ve stripped her naked instead of covering her. 
On the other hand Maureen hasn’t lost anything, instead she’s gained. She’s gained Sarah’s family and husband. Maureen you never considered Sarah, you were never for her otherwise you would have put your selfish needs aside and never allowed yourself to give in to the tricks of this man who was betraying his wife and family. As far as you’re concerned you have won - you probably feel good I’m sure because this man Abraham was more than willing to risk losing his current family and wife in particular for you. 
I’m sorry you had to go through that Sarah. I can tell how hard you’re trying to hide your pain. You have no choice but to put a smile on your face and play along and pretend to be in control of the situation for the sake of those you know are talking behind your back. You have to force yourself to hold your head high. 
You’re a godly woman and you wanna please God by being forgiving and respectful. God loves his daughters, you’re precious to Him. It’s not His will that we be subjected to any form of abuse, even emotional abuse. 

I know you’re probably still asking yourself questions, shocked that this is your life, and still trying hard to rebuild your confidence and self esteem . Your wound is still fresh and your selfish husband is expecting you to just move on with it. Oh I wish I can give you a hug sis."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Fun fact: He has a side chic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and Mourine are happy but not cerah.. she's hiding something
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Basis of it all, someone was hurt. It all started with infidelity. Weeeeuh this life is hard"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"this is totally  non sense from you highly respectable journalist Lynn Ngugi, you want to tell us that you want to promote polygamy on this channel omg that's too barbaric, do u know negative impact it would have on society in future.....mark my word you will get a lot of negative response...anyways wishing them best luck !!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kiumbani no kiumbani na ndikarumwo ni mundu
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife should just look for her own husband..You are hurting Serah for no reason
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn my girl, I love you and watch all your content. Hii imenishinda! Eight years and then just like that your life is re-written by immortality glossed in the name of “second wife”🙄🙄 Gerraouttoff here"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤐
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, hata wewe ungeingia hapo!!!!!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What is that value that goes beyond love?  love is the greatest of all.Abraham don't try to confuse us you love Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The only person really enjoying this three-some is Abraham. He is having his cake and eating it, the ladies have agreed to share him and he is having a blast! Wow life is a ...... 🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Some women here are speaking as if what this man did was wrong yet your hubbies are busy chewing side chicks and taking care of kids they sire with those side chicks without your knowledge. Si heri Abraham decided to make the first wife know about the second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Betrayal at it's best..let's call a spade a spade and not a big spoon bana..I hope Cera heals and gets over it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waah!Is this real?.You can't serve two masters at a time.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is forced to smile on camera
q4sWUJxjc4g,fact remains Abraham cheated on this kind lady.There is nothing fancy about this whole arrangement
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera looks like she is the second wife. Younger in fact.. 
This whole arrangement is nuts. Personally I wouldn't accept such rubbish.. it's either me or me. Never us at any point. You cheat, I let you go.  Simple."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the pain of betrayal from someone you love is immeasurable.I feel Cera coz it's clear she only had to move along.May God expound your Territories Cera and someday you'll decide on how you can live your life happy and not worried of how to support your kids.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes leta the wanjohis lyne
q4sWUJxjc4g,Immeasurable pain
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story has no ability to impact.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please 🙏🏽 new generation let we don’t live polygamy like ours grandfathers it really pain when a man brings another’s woman in to yrs love ❤️ it’s really pain and it this will never ended  good never let we live in historical???????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man met the love of his life while still married to Sera, and he took advantage of his 'timid' wife, she is too calm and on the path of marriage ni kuvumilia, my own will not try that rubbish with me, loving me should not be hard for you, if it is ever a choice btwn me and another woman please choose her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is very beautful n young
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The walls hide a lot,  If you know you know."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Those saying sijui abraham hapendi sara kwani humuoni sarah bado anazaa meaning abraham is very busy everywhere...i love them..na to the Abrahams ebu my onions zinifikie please
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is too toxic. I can't deal. And Abraham is the problem. He will definitely get a 3rd and a forth. He started from scratch with serah and payback was bringing another woman. Aaahhhh nonsense!!!  Please women don't allow yourself to be treated this way
q4sWUJxjc4g,There's just too much to learn in this life.... Get love and respect and working really hard to earn such respect... Hongera Sir Abraham....
q4sWUJxjc4g,3rd wife loading
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God removed arib from Man and created a woman, not women"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is madly in love with Maureen and I can bet he was ready to lose Cera to be with Maureen. Let's tell the truth, Cera was betrayed. He is looking at Maureen more than Cera and that's love. Hopefully with all those interviews, Cera will get healing as soon as possible and move on with her life."
q4sWUJxjc4g,True in metha ya kagoni he would leave for 3 days.. And he had been sent diapers when they moved to a new house. Kumbe he was with Maureen.. Plus same career choice ICT.. LOADS in common
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Elizabeth it's how you have taken it out of my mouth for me how ""His Face is slappable"""
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kabisaa I thought so. Anapenda Maureen more
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera open your eyes, you are beautiful and you can live without those dramas, that man betrayed you and he is disrespecting you todate, he said he told you "" this could be the end of our family and end of me and you"" meaning he was ready to lose YOU to have Maureen. Wanawake by the way mjipende ala. Maureen mark my words, one day you will pay dearly for your actions. Shame on you ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife is more prettier than the second one... 🤣 🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not nature of business, it's lust"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I know Mungu wa Sera ako.Maureen there is always a reward for everything you do on earth. So I pray for Sera
q4sWUJxjc4g,"By the look of things, this man is narcissistic!!! period!  cera isn't truly happy tuongeeni tu ukweli. this picture-perfect ,look like its a  camera opp truly feeding the man's  ego of being famous!  so this man cheated on his wife, a woman whom they started with nothing!  brought the side chic home,  pure slap in the face!!! and akichunguzwa hakosi ako na side mwingine somewhere! cheaters are never satisfied no matter who the fudge you are! To this other gal, how can you break another womans house and be comfortable to show your face to the world?! this is audacity and guts combined! rusheni mawe but this is wrong! and i am not going glorify evil! if this narcissist told cera he was polygamist then and only then this is okay. if he dint then he is a man whore period!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This bulshit
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Self Love Deficit (SLDD)is real. One grows up believing that they are ""less than worthy' accepting breadcrumbs falling off the table of a selfish narcissist who regularly gaslights them into denying the reality that they are being abused. It's because of their broken consciousness. Ladies wake up! you're made in God's image & likeness; stop accepting trashy treatment. Your identity is not in being Mrs so & so, discover & actualize the Queen God intended you to be."
q4sWUJxjc4g,1:19 was the best part woooooow 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😅😅😅😅😅😅😅  aky they are happy may this happiness dwell forever in their home 😘😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have seen them on another interview but the most important question asked by Lynn is whether it's possible for one person to love two people at the same time!
The way he answered it just confused me🥱. I'm not sure if I understood him.🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mum He speak on behalf of Sara almost  everytime...Leave her to answer all questions.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is so beautiful..woi why allow yourself to go this kind of shit
q4sWUJxjc4g,WE CANNOT GLORIFY UNGODLINESS
q4sWUJxjc4g,"cera she is too beautiful,humble,and wise woman,hug cera I feel her pain"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So l have watched this interview twice on two separate channels but Lynn Ngugi nailed it....girl you have a gift. You're so professional yet very knowledgeable on how to navigate the tough questions without making your guests uncomfortable and at the same time helping us the viewers understand in depth . I mean it's like I'm watching them for the first time. LN you never disappoint
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same here ...Lynn asked what what was in our mind
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same
q4sWUJxjc4g,she's the best!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Definitely, he will bring in a third,fourth wife...once aplygamous ....it goes on.These people have plastic smile/lough 🙄, they are on camera,defending  their shame"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Digehota niii one house reke nemwo
q4sWUJxjc4g,Many talk ill of this family but many of us have a mpango or we're talking but our husbands have mpango out there...let's just pray that this spirit of polygamy is uprooted from our society
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm actually here for the comments, coz wueeh, Cera is in pain, it's so clear in her eyes. I feel her pain."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The tears will haunt you Abraham..
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn chunga usikuwe No. 3 hapo... naona tudalili 🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am sure if Sarah had money she couldn't tolerate such nonsense ,ladies let's not depend on men totally look for something to do"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The audacity of this man.. He doesn't love the first wife , he married her out of convinience. He can't even why he loved her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Have gone through the comments, Lyns audience always analyse a story in the best way possible."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You see,I was starting to romantize the situation until I opened the comments section"
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God keep this family..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Interesting...
Mimi sitasema kitu lakini nitashangaa tu😳"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham is so brave to bring on 2nd lady,men we r polygamous nothing strange here.Existed with our grandparents even more than two."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your looking good guys just like sisters keep it up men outside there  they have mipango za kando and they keep it as a secret hypocrisy Abraham big up wish u all the best happy family
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne you did this so we'll🤗❤️

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those judging,,,,,,??????? please look at yourself your life then judge,,,some here are ugly mipangos who can't even be brought to light,,,,I think you who have watched to the end have seen they are extremely happy n rich mmmmmmh......May God bless this family and protect them from jealous people...One day,I say one day ehee I WILL TELL MY STORY ...All the very best sweethearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love serah🥰 I hope it's well with her.... Sending her lots of love 💗 coz this is not easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why are women making noise here? If Sarah is happy why does it concern you? These are the lunatics who break homes by poisoning women and when they are kicked out the only advice they can offer ni kufungua kibanda ya mboga!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you have done this interview so well💕
q4sWUJxjc4g,mwanaume anakaa tu malaya the second woman is very old
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There’s this song, ‘Gallery’ by Mario Vasquez...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mind the business that God gave you fam.everything isn’t for everyone,kaa hii si vako yako then keep it pushing…..let this beautiful family be!!
Brathee anaitwa Abraham,what a fitting name.🤣😂it was in the books that Abraham would be a great man"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I'm really getting mad with this story😙Dear God when it's my time I don't want to be like Cerah🤲
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God save us all from such men! Nobody deserves this...atleast deep down we women know what we feel at the end of it all. Knowing you were not enough and was never what he wanted leaves you heart broken. I seriously cant even watch this to the end am overwhelmed and a single lady am scared! marriage whatever it is , has become a battle field or stadium for people to play games. I see men are adopting new trends but the question remains ....have men ever thought that women too have choices out and can also add on the numbers?? And have the men ever thought why women dont do what they do publically even with the endless temptations they encounter outside their marraiges?? Anyway as a teacher i wonder at what we've become! May God armor us with strength and growth in this harsh world. To the genuinely good men and women out there God bless🙏 you!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Living in a dreamland these women
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯 this was disturbing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,So true...Kwanza the most hurting ni 1st wife...This total nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing convincing
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen n The Devil Perverts Us n we need God’s intervention
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen homewrecker 🥺serah I love you
q4sWUJxjc4g,People have a big heart… Me i know I CANT !!
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless Cera…… Not easy but somehow God have given you wisdom and God will bless you… For Morine… God knows… otherwise aman who marries two wives can easily go to four .. am not judging but all the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,SARA is really heart broken 💔.. She's just faking the smile and laughter but deep inside she's crying 😭..oh God give Sarah a peaceful mind
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That's what I thought too..
Poor woman is laughing but deep inside she's really hurting!! She was betrayed 💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,During hug time...thinking sharing her Love with a stranger to her husband..
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Agree
q4sWUJxjc4g,True Sarah is heartbroken
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first woman is not happy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is betrayal of highest order. Living in the same  house is a disgrace . Cerah had no choice but to accept, she is hurt . She is just smiling for the camera. No love here .SCAM"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii ni vindeo ama ni ndrama.Afro cinema continues shortly.Serah is strong.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would prefer to stay in my own house bt we can't share sera had no option bt to protect her marriage maybe sometime in future she will move out
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Marriage is a SCAM .....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some men are sadists! It the 1st wife had a boyfriend  what could  father Abraham  do? Nie
maundu Maya .mbona kubebwa ufala"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The two women look together😛
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mwanamme anapopenda  sio kuwa  anampenda mwanamke  100% atapretand  tu  .  kwa sababu   inawezekana  kuna mambo ameyakosa  hapo  ila  atayapata kwengine .  kwa hiyo  atakuwa  kwa  huyu amependa  shape kwa  yule  atampendea    rangi   na mwengine  atampendea  sauti  na mwengine  atampendea   ajira  yake   n.k
q4sWUJxjc4g,Just from the beginning- he did not own them- “am a husband to so and so father to so and so” I always listen to the first words the rest ni story
q4sWUJxjc4g,As a Christian l cannot support such immorality in the form of modernization this is wrong. Serah I wish you ask God for wisdom
q4sWUJxjc4g,shame on this man huyu anafunza watu nini sasa???na ndio maana mnauliwa mapema mkiwa na mabibi wengi
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I watched then on NTV sometimes back,Serah doesn't have alot of many unlike the second wife seems to be rich and that's what the husband fell in love most..Let me not judge"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera is hurting ,I hope she is cooking something for this 2, Abraham loves moreen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"99.9% of people in the comments section see something wrong in this kind of a marriage. I'm sure the family too they don't view it has an ordinary kind of relationship, that's why they are moving from one chanel to the next everyday. Someone is seeking attention somewhere. Lakini pesa lazima itafutwe regardless. Looking for publicity and fame..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know what will make me stay in such a marriage when I have my own business and it's doing well...Sera is not happy I don't know why she chose to Stay
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sametimes in life you have to take lip of faith because if you don't agree you will regret later better take risky tell GOD to wolk with you because is not going to be easy round
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have never commented on any story but this one is just something else.

1. he has the audacity of telling the wife, he will not stop supporting the side chick?
2. He also states that he has no intention of ''chasing'' Cerah from the marriage.

Who told him he has even bargaining power? These men!! yaani he goes cheat, impregnates a another woman,  sire a child (meaning he had unprotected sex, what if Moreen had STI?) and then he still thinks he can dictate what to say to Cerah.

Cerah, I am not in your shoes, lakini,...wueeh!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men are leaving in hidden polygamous marriages, Abraham has owned up and living with his publicly."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Father Abraham is gonna get 3rd and 4th wives with no time,,,,, Cerah is strong woman🥺"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel for Serah as a human being someone must be hurting  but time will tell. Let the word of the Lord remain true.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wish Sarah can get someone who will only love her, and for Maureen , You shouldn’t be wearing someone else’s shoes and I could see your face, and you’re heart can tell, you’re doing something, you shouldn’t be doing, stealing someone’s love is ****WRONG PERIOD**** 
you should go and find someone for yourself not ***STEALING*** 
And what God has put together no man can separate"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Keep your house in order, Jesus is coming soon!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for Sarah, it may look normal today but in future things will not be as we see them. Maurine is heartless. Abraham could raise the child without bringing Maurine in their family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Those who were raised in polygamous family, are you happy?
I believe in monogamous family and the Bible is very clear about this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,His name had to be Abraham. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. This is on a very light note 🤠
q4sWUJxjc4g,All this while I thought Serah was the second wife...She looks younger and prettier until I watched this interview...Serah Aki whatever you wanna do to build yourself get out of that funky circle...We will support you
q4sWUJxjc4g,True Serah looks younger
q4sWUJxjc4g,I  thought so too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too.i thought Maureen was the first wife and serah second wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is sooooo beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is so cute and reserved. 
Humbleness  is written  allover her.
Sarah  God lifts the humble  and the meek."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Oooh lord may this never happen to me🙏😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen's  reason's are beyond child reasoning.  You don't get to have a cheat as a husband.  This is a cycle....
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's Maureen and Serah's friendship for me❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1st corinthians 7:2 says each man should have his own wife and each woman his own husband. 
Genesis 2:24 says for this reason aman shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one fresh.
What this man and second wife doing is wrong and against God. It is One Wife not wife's and one flesh not two. God recognizes the first wife coz he doesn't join two but one."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is in love with Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Goja uone wamama wivu na makasiriko 😅😅😅😅kwa comments
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is exactly why our grandparents did polygamy ,they also said it is beyond love and they believed more in the family unit,if wife no.2 come also no.3 atakuja pia,the first wife is really selfless to accept this, may God give her more grace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woiye Cerah’s eyes reveals all the pain and dissapointment she has gone through hugs to her huyu mwanaume ni fisi tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's  she's not going anywhere for me,so Ur left with no choice"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think the wife is very heart broken God have mercy on us all 💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,yea huyu n fisi tu..maybe ata third wife ako pending
q4sWUJxjc4g,yea huyu n fisi tu..maybe ata third wife ako pending
q4sWUJxjc4g,hii nimeshindwa na kuwatch. its  pure IMMORAL
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waah! Weuh!...😯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Stop throwing stones.,..until you find yourself in that kind of a situation that when you will realize you can be Maureen"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nkiest go away with your lies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why are people judging Maureen she is a nice woman ..and from the looks of things she truly respects cerah ...May God bless them and always protect them and they retain the love among them ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Being raised in such a family's serah is not comfortable neither is she okey she just have a good heart ...she just place her Co wife child in her shoes and decides being Goldly she will lay low and allow the kid enjoy her father's love and not deny her and may God bless her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueh, devil is a liar"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mtoto Amelia aki...wah
q4sWUJxjc4g,mbona ibrahimu na maureen wamemachisha hadi shoes na tops kiasi kufanana huwa wanambeba sera ufala sana my thots tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hi business ya serah ikuje
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The man is very very happy, enjoying his two wives but are the women equally happy?  Was he playing these women? 
Is it really love?
Are the women sacrificing there happiness.?
Will they be together the next 40 years.?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham very selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am watching this to support My gal Lynn but this is crap to me I can't do this nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To my own understanding Maureen is not that bad, she just fell on the hands of the wrong guy(married), fell in love and found a good lady serah...
She was accommodated in the family...
If you fell in love with another Lady when you are with another one, it means it's her you love...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the saddest interview to be honest
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I just loved their sincerity, honestly and maturity big up Lynn 😍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing is sincere here this Man is a betrayal of his kind
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is cool calm and a quiet woman that's is why it was easy for Maureen and Abraham to lake her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Short man syndrome.  What is he trying to prove now. Desparcito!! Perverted
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki Maureen wewe ,anywho just watched this because it's on our girls shanoo 😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like the way Lynn asked some questions God bless you mummy 🥰🥰  your are my mentor 🙏🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera you so beautiful,ata you don't seem to have three children,I pray you get out of this relationship,this man is using you because you love him,and this Maureen will come to show her true colors soon"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love is jealous.sarah sleep with one eye wide open.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is such a big liar and a home breaker, she new very well that Abraham has a wife! How stupid are you to vibe with a man to an extened  of having a kid without digging well to know the person and his familly 🤔 kwani you never visited Abraham to know where he's living? You were being taken for a coffee date then lodging ama ulikuwa  Dem wa kuaccomodate wanaume? How can you big lady invade the privacy of another woman? What if ingekuwa wewe ama ikue mtoto wako? how would you feel? Serah is not ok no matter how you pple try to smile on camera! Stop advicing our good girls to have a punious behaviour like you!    and stop using Sera because you came to her home like a house girl! Unakasirikia mwenye nyumba ati hajakusaidia Kazi kwani yeye ni mtoto haezi kuwa na time yake kucall ama kupick calls? Shame on you, you cannot even convince your husband to buy you a plot akujenge hao Yako🤪🤪🤪"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am so proud of this family...standing out openly and owning up everything. You are blessed
q4sWUJxjc4g,100% on point !
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen truth be told your thunder is boiling
q4sWUJxjc4g,He only loves Maureen. Cera hakufukuzwa because of the kids. Am sure If she decided to leave Abraham and Maureen would be living together happily married. This is not rocket science you can see who the man loves. Cera from the word go was married for the wrong reasons by a broke guy back then who just needed someone who would cook and clean.The moment he got his money he pursued the woman of his dreams. Read Btw the lines then go argue with your village people 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"After watching this, all I can say is that WODERS will never seaze. My heart goes to you Cera. May God open your eyes so that you see how beautiful and worthy you are. Even in Kikuyu culture co wives lived in different houses. Moureen can justify herself as much as she wants but nothing will ever make this right or admirable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Everybody is someone else wierdo.
q4sWUJxjc4g,God of Jacob the father of Israel will give her a big congrats. Israel wouldn't be if Leah didn't allow Michal to join her marriage. There wd been no Jesus without Poly
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is a home laker  Abraham is heart breaker
q4sWUJxjc4g,"God Almighty who created the world in just six days created eve who's just 1 woman for Adam had a reason why He ever created 2 eves.Not that He was not able to created another woman for Adam but because He knows human beings and animals very well to just stay in pairs  not triplets.In Gods eyes this is not acceptable.
Evrything will be in pairs
Human
Animals
Plants
🤐"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kenyans are not ready for this kind of honesty and openness.  We Kenyans are used to being lied to and busy being side chics and all.... I personally don't find anything wrong . You are a gentle man who's bold... let the rest of the wababas learn from you...I love your story and I think yours is a beautiful story... LOVE WINS!!🥰🥰..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also don't find an issue 😂😂,ama tuko na Shida.Heri hii kuliko kufichwa kama mihadarati."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@nyamburaadventures_ke I know right!!!  🤣🤣hatuna shida.. Hivi ndivo inafaa cz wababa wakenya wamejaza side chics...
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@rhodamakena6379 to me it's better umfiche huko nisimjue juu at the moment utapata guts mpaka za kumleta kwa nyumba it's either am gone or she is gone i can't outstand shits kama hizi anymore 🙄🙄very heartbroken for sure 💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@fatimaabdulla6967 okay kumleta Kwa nyumba is abit overboard and dramatic for the guy actually 😂.Shows porous boundaries amongst the three of them.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@nyamburaadventures_ke kwanza if umewatch the whole story huko mwisho ati Maureen alinuna juu ya Sera yuko busy kwa simu instead wafanye kazi za nyumba kutakuja wageni that's clearly shows how the real life is between them waache kusema we are OK how? Kwanza mm ningekua Sara vile vituko ningemfanyia huyo Maureen angekoma juu singepigana kwa maneno au kusukumana na yeye lakini nae angechokana na drama zangu juu i can't leave my house its either Atoke na huyo bwana waende waniache kwangu with my kids na vyombo angeosha Sana asugue na ukuta kabisa Mavi kabisa yy😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bullshit!!!Serah open your eyes maaa' 😩❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is bull****
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham found his soulmate Maureen  after his marriage to Serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Heeee ladies which one would you rather? Your husband cheating on you and never finding out or him bringing a second wife🤔?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wickedness should be called out!! Na a covenant is only between two ppl…
No man can serve two masters at the same in the same way… do not be decieved!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Threesome too much fluids.  Body fluids. Wakizeeka kufightia mali watajua hawajui
q4sWUJxjc4g,No way l will agree to polgamy and allow my husband to marry another unless l am sick or unable .... catch you behind my back .then its divorce ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lyn what's happening with the subtitles?
q4sWUJxjc4g,What caught your eyes was cleaning😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Now watching this 
Shit is really deep"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Was wondering where i get his  number😂😂😂😂😂😂to be his number 3😜
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abrahams empire my foot!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn to be honest serah is not happy at all her husband to marry her friend and she's not happy to stay in the same house with her co_wife though she pretend
Much love from Uganda i love you so much"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Love and hip hop Kenya 😂
Stevie J,  Mimi Faust and Joseline 😂😂😂 
I'm sorry Lynn but I don't believe they are happy. This is a house of cards."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What a destructive selfish  man Abraham  is..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham you are blessed by who????...God cannot bless sin...Do not be delusional .We do right by God by correcting each other in our faith and ""you are a sinner too""doesn't make yours right.There is no one that is alive that has no sin but we do good by acknowledging and correcting our ways."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is absolutely stunning and very intelligent. Despite all the pain this man is putting her through, she still carries herself like a Proverbs 31 woman....In my opinion, she deserves better.

Praying God's protection and guidance over her.

Thanks for sharing this interview Lynn. Much love from 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Tiyaila c cera is just kind but she is not a proverbs 31 woman.
A proverbs 31 woman is Godly, Hardworking and Virtuous.A virtuous woman would flee from sexual immorality."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@nanaloreta743 I understand what your saying. However, biblically she is still carrying herself as a wife should regarding grace, loyalty and commitment. 

1 Corinthians 7:10-11 ""And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: 11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.""

Matthew 5:31-32 ""It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.""

 If she has viewed verses such as these, I understand why she possibly feels obligated to stay married to him... But who knows, she could also  be working out her exit plan as we speak lol."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sincerely speaking I dont think Serah is at peace, reality is that she has to accept but deep down she is not comfortable.I pray that this does not happen to any woman"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham and sarah 🤣🤣 sara and Hagai its a bit of the BIBLE
q4sWUJxjc4g,This woman is just something else I was scared of what home wrecker
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am sooo shocked...i know Abraham and did not know he has 2 wives...we schooled together in high school..waaah this issa no for me
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I never felt so bad like I did today, no  human being who's not jealous and especially in marriage,  I heard Sarah say ,""hana bahati isipokuwa bwana and she'd tears,  this lady is hopeless Lynn she needs to consult a psychologist, she needs someone so genuine and patient so that she opens up, May God heal her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes, there is something that has been happening before she got married to this Kinuthia. She needs counselling."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is really pained and 🤕 hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truth be told, Sarah is suffering. Abraham no longer loves her. Pain can be seen in her eyes. She is going along with this interview but she hurts."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen the husband snatcher 😏😏😏 this man loves Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ofcos you throw your phones  now because your philandering partner is in your house ..cmon ...this is the typical Father Abraham contradicting himself eti they were open to each other mara no one touches his phone... nkt ... too selfish ...I feel for cerah and its clear she's still feeling the pain .. these two ganged to calm their coital desires..nkt ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Gen 2 23-24 
And Adam said, this is now bone of my bones,flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman,because she was taken out of man.

Therefore shall a man leaves his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one.

Shall be called woman not women,shall cleave unto his wife not wives...ukweli usemwe hapa sera didn't have a choice..bt since there ok with that...we just let them be.....they are grown ups 😉 they know Chenye wanafanya."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am not going to judge them ... live to God to judge you but the truth the father can still be put of there  children life without destroying your friends marriage 🥰🥰🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is in God's perfect plan. If it was not, it would not have worked from the word go. Instead of the girls digging their nails into each others skin, they embraced..see, God's doing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah, you are very beautiful ❤️. Just leave that toxic marriage!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham lived with Serah cause she was/is a hard worker. The other lady wants Abraham cause he's a man of quality..the quality that Serah has put in
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Won't comment more but i feel for Sarah's heart 💔💔💔,,Sarah to be honest you're in that marriage for the sake of your kid's......for you Abraham heaven knows you're Sarah's husband ... Maureen look for your own husband...."
q4sWUJxjc4g,A big disgusting ego.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy was cheating tuseme tu ukweli
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii nayo Ni Kali Lynn! Otherwise let them be....Kila Mtu na maisha yake... vile unataka...in this life wakua Ni wora!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Betrayal
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like you lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,So he was ready to loose Sarah..en moreen akuwe Kwa pic...he loves moreen then Sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love Abraham's dimple oooh Lord😎
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's Impossible to Love two People at the same time.Aki Sarah,ningejitoa Tu Kwa hii Nuks.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woi ati Leo kumenyesha sitacome home Weuh nipewe drink aki
q4sWUJxjc4g,"On this and after watching it from somewhere else and also in their channel, Abraham loves the 2nd more than the 1st unfortunately, it seems she has no choice but to remain in this relationship. Wish she never allowed they live in together but separate houses. Marry how many you wish but keep them apart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Glorified sin
q4sWUJxjc4g,Leta story ya conjestina acheng we need to know what happened to her
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham anakaa kuhanya, and for moureen she is wasting herself"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"ALWAYS we should not JUDGE....
Men don't come out to disclose number 2 and it's the reason people judging feel SAFE and think they are ALONE in marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is nonsense the man seems not honest so conflicting stories here and the women don't pretend you love each other  a woman enemy is another emeny living on the same loof this is nonsemss
q4sWUJxjc4g,"A marriage that begins in a lie usually ends in tears . Some cultures do allow polygamy but i don’t believe the husbands sneak around or lie to add another wife into the family. Anyway , each to their own but my husband is mine and mine only. 😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wewe na mimi tuko kimoja
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,Alot hurting inside Sarah's heart no one can deny that unless she is different from the other women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Tuko wengi kwa hii chama na akitaka kuongezea,basi itabidi ajipange ki vyake."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Heeeee this kind of grace Hapana, haki mimi ningefugwa kamiti for  life ,I can't stand a cheating man ,and welcome sidechick  to  our home ,its betrayal  no matter what ,
I can't see how you can love two women passionately ,it's not natural"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the best interview ever ...I really respect Sarah and maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham thumbs up...kindly take good care of those ladies..ur such gentleman
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueh!looking beyond love.... serah was a caretaker and  Maureen naye business  partner. This family will prosper.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You have no apologies? that is arrogant! you ladies should be ashamed of being turned into doormats.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera is so beautiful 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is danger in loving somebody too much, thus the reason Serah stayed aki!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I will never judge if theey are happy whoms are we?? Abraham, cera and maureen...mob love"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is very beautiful 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is something I've felt for Sarah, like nimemhurumia tu... That humbleness that allows her to accept everything is on another level. Only God and her who understands what she  feels deeeeeeeep down."
q4sWUJxjc4g,she needs to love herself more than others .  since that man is not God . if he dies today will she also die ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is simply happy n contentend
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Very sad,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wacha tu
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jesus!Very true dia
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mapenzi wewe 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is very brilliant it's good to allow him bring that second wife c oz no matter what he will cheat
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not funny, not something to talk about."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't think I'd promote polygamy coz for real Sarah seems like she has a gap which she didn't have a solution but to let it be. Sarah my namesake I salute you for being strong
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤔 mmmm is not easy at all 😕
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1 Corinthians 7:2 But since there is so much immorality,each man should have his own wife,and each woman her own husband.Hebrews 13:4-5 Marriage should be honoured by all,and the marriage bed kept pure,for GOD will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.5 keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have,because GOD has said,""Never will I leave you;never will I forsake you."""
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ok we understand you love them, but separate them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Premium tears loading because the “KIUMBANI” pro max will bring in a 3rd and even 4th if they are not there already!
But the audacity of this KIUMBANI , he hasn’t even finished paying dowry for Cera and brings in a second wife?
Alafu, why can’t he build his second/mpango her own house?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am not legalizing poligamy but this family was made in heaven because am from the kind of it but wasn't very easy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Good friends 😎,na hata Cera hacheki😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if baby Pendo had not seen the picture of the baby on the dad's phone ? 🤔 Don't you think this could still be a secret between Maureen and Abraham?
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤔🤔🤔 imagine!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Watched from the start to the last, I admire and respect  this family . They have positively publicly shared very important topic that is ""killing""many out there with lots of questions but without genuine answers.
👉 I've learned that if many would come up openly and accept that they are dating outside than cheating and legalize their relationships possibly many would be to some good extend happy than living life full of stress....
God bless and unite this family forever 🤲"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shame shame shame to this adulterous hypocritical of a men who is lustful  and cheater nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,Normalized cheating is here.hugs hugs Sarah.okey.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let people read the word carefully, in the bk of Exodus 21:10 says if a man takes another wife he should make sure all the duties should be adminished.Its better for a man to marry two instead of taking advantage of other women pretending ha want to have one wife and sleeps with more women out there."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn some of this shows are watering your show because they are satainizim and abuse to the society what this hypocrite man trying to teach our young men this is abomination period  I see hypocrisy in all this love triangle nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,What does the bible say about marriage? Let each of you think about this.Maureen nothing justifies getting married as a second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like how Lynn handled this interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,"One day Serah will open her inner eyes and see she is ' being played '. From the way Baba(omg that's so funny 😃) is looking at Maureen, he is truly more in love with her. They work together, spend all the time together...it's just a matter of time. Hope they do another interview in 5 years time."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He will also fall out of love for Maureen,fall in love with other women out their,what goes around comes around,it's never enough with such men"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man cannot be quenched. Maureen should be honest and say she manipulated ..it wrong to come to a married and claim its love.
I am old School, and I feel for Serah.
All the blessings unto Serah.
They took advantage of her being polite.
Maureen you did wrong.
Period."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@jennifermcwhortet7934 his trying to normalize this shit it  horribly wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hmm truth is they took advantage of Sarah’s nature to oppress her and force her into this madness
q4sWUJxjc4g,Waiting for this after some years
q4sWUJxjc4g,Not a hateful comment but whatever is brewing here will be deadly Sarah is probably planning something
q4sWUJxjc4g,"there's no happiness in this, the man even when doing introduction,his eyes are on the young chick! 
Serah you're a strong woman, stay there, love people, take good care of yourself and your family. Pray and watch"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mapenzi wewe🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bibi mdogo anakaa kuzeaka
q4sWUJxjc4g,sarah was a place holder for this man ..then she got pregnant and married him ...maureen on the other hand is the woman he loves
q4sWUJxjc4g,May I ask is it the plan of God because anything done away from Gods will is a sin let’s be looking matters on spiritual perspective this man  I can tell is a womanizer and am sure with no doubt he has concubines outside there because it’s not nature to love two women at the same time and make them wives something a miss here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I do not like you Abraham. You are not a good man. You broke your wife, and you smile so comfortably. Shame on you. 
Say you are sorry to Sarah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Biblically all this is wrong!! 2nd Maureen was not married in the right way but it was infidelity,  Abraham cheated on Cerah and had a child with Maureen before even letting Cera know, he didn't even inform Cera, she saw it when her child saw the pics on the phone. When Hagar got Ishmael,  GOD still told Abraham to do what Sarah his wife would tell him. And it's GOD who called Isaac, Abraham's ONLY son. Genesis 16 &17. We see the covenant and promises GOD gave Abraham because of Isaac.
In this story, Cera is just hiding pain. Let's not endorse wrongs calling it right. Infidelity is even the only reason allowed in the Bible for divorce.  The foundation of this marriage of two women is on infidelity!!! And my opinion you can't love two women the same..this is Social media,  where people are pretending to please the world...
For me watching them is even painful, it's not only polygamy that's praised here but also infidelity!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't know am angry at this dude
q4sWUJxjc4g,God is not a God of confusion he gave Adam one woman who was Eve as a helper. Unless you tell me the bible has changed I will agree that it's Gods doing
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not in for this,am very disappointed,,think of the future generations,personally have never seen a happy polygamous family,,fighting for materialistic things,differences will definately come after when the parents are gone maybe,but sahi u won't see the other side of it"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woman are always, woman's worst enemy. They always want what another woman has,even  their  husband. She is a sad woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"AM SPEECHLESS,,,I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT PART OF EARTH I AM IN AT THIS POINT,,,,Let me mind my business owada"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Disgusting he is having the best bot both worlds the women have low self esteem
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is hurt....no woman can agree on this I hope she find the peace she deserves....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't support polygamy...the man was already decided and ok with the two wives..but I wish Maureen stood her grounds not to be second wife,,,cerah is the one suffering..here"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"According to me,Sara  is not happy ni vile hana choice."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think Abraham is hiding something but he defend Maureen because of his business my opinion is Abraham is a selfish but as it said time will tell lynn keep a calendar then come five years then review this story every stone must sit on each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nimewapenda sana mko wapi niwatembelee
q4sWUJxjc4g,For serah to invite Maureen to stay in her house she must have understood how deep inlove her husband was. She was loosing him. My heart ached for her in that moment. I think Maureen agreed to move in because of the guilt she feels for her part in this. Both women are clearly good people. I wish them all the best. No judgement here✌️
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne your journalism is on higher level....on the other show the pain of serah didn't come out but today I've seen and felt her....it's normal for husband's to Katia Katia even when married....but a normal woman kuingia box na clearly she knew theirs a wife somewhere...?at Maureens age she decided to get pregnant so as to be in the picture....she knew very well uprotected sex leads to.......so clearly she meant evil but serahs Wisdom clearly won.....If all women could open legs to peoples husband how could the world look like ..... ukweli usemwe you are a homebreaker ni vile hapa serah was wise........Adui wa mwanamke ni mwanamke....Serah usiseme sikusema she is still looking for a better strategy to keep him for herself alone....Usidanganyike let Maureen have her own 🏠 hata Kama you share husband.....kesho kesho tutaskia ilikua food poison.....si kwa ubad....the pain in Serah is deep
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@violetaseyo5005 wow, some great thoughts here!! Indeed  separate houses is a good idea... I wonder how I'd feel to hear my co-wife moan in pleasure in my house, in her bedroom, with my husband as I pass by....🏃🏃 anyway, no judging 🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah has pain,but no other  wise"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How do u wish pple well in hell🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love is beautiful 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn asked Maureen why she agreed to be romantic and have a child with Abraham even after knowing he's married but she couldn't answer clearly.All the best
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn it's 😣😣😣😣😣,for Serah ,this man just talks about materials when it's about Serah but love about Maureen."
q4sWUJxjc4g,She can't even express herself clearly without repeating her mouth is getting dry too. Skiza Serah very composed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen  is a NOooo
q4sWUJxjc4g,not watched but weeh...🤕
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen can you pack and leave,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is a definition of moral decay in our society.she knew exactly what she was doing.Let her leave.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ironed socks woow
q4sWUJxjc4g,The way this man describes how he met the two women tells it all. For the first wife nikama anajaribu kusema alijipeleka...
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah today is getting answers that she probably have waited to understand!! Thanks lynn for asking the right questions!!! Everyone see how serah is looking at father Abraham esp when Lynn ask why he asked for coffee date while he can do it with his wife…I feel so bad for serah…
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham do yourself a favour and choose your second wife, stop wasting cera time becouse you don't love her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As much I don't support  polygamy, i respect their decision and pray they stick it to the end, but considering each staying in her own house especially when kids start maturing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I can't share my personal property,never😂anaingia huko na anakuja kwangu,ptaii,never,,heri nisijue😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Disgusting what honor is this he is getting two women to have sex with the women have low self esteem
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Somethings you should just let go, hata kama you have a whole novel to write about it...these are adults probably raised in christian home, hizi propaganda zote mnasema hapa mara oo christianity,mara oo immorality. All yee moral saints,how are your relationships doing?🙄 Wote wako successful, kwani kama sarah anaona amekosewa, amefungwa na superglue🤔mwachane na watu waishi maisha yao"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ive seen the thumbnail of this video na nikaskia hasira already it cant happen the love wont be equal and one either has no option or the other is after smth...polygamy tena nyumba moja how now jamani
q4sWUJxjc4g,Na Lynn una thighland fiti
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even before I listen to them, I must say...
God's standards on marriage will never change to suit our desires or changing norms in our society. 
#TeamOneWifeOneHusband🙌🙌"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Amen, Highly well said 💯"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why is it so prevalent in the Bible?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly!!!! No matter how much we pretend to accept.... GOD's standard never changes
q4sWUJxjc4g,True one wife one husband full stop
q4sWUJxjc4g,I concur with you definitely.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""...muithikiri ndakwera ni wa andu eeri....wagatatu ni wa mwirigiririo..."""
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Abraham and Cerah were living in a bedsitter Maureen could not have followed them....pesa! Maureen is being played in her own game...how do you agree to go stay in another woman's house.....put your enemies closer with a smile
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Moureen is a lier.. Aty she had said she knew the man was married and here she is saying she didn't know.. Lier kabisaa..
I wish Serah the very best.. She deserves better honestly😭😭"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham sounds as though he would go through with Maureen anyway whether Cera liked it or not.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's painful for Sera....no woman would like to share his man period
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's not interesting,I grew up in such situation, things seemed normal and good but deep within was pain , betrayal and perseverance especially the betrayed,even now we have no good relationship with my step bros and sisters"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn i love how you interview your guests. You know how to ask questions that are in your followers mind.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii nayo ni kizungumkuti,i can't  entertain  this,i feel the 1st wife,huyu mwanaume weeeh,ni moto"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This to me feels betrayal of the highest level
q4sWUJxjc4g,Life 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is madness,BS, so men kujeni hapa since we also are human beings does it mean we go loving our coworkers because we work together? Or is it that after a disagreement you marry !?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have listened to this story before and today I've felt Serah's pain. I feel like she didn't have a choice. She was a woman who did not want to lose her family and she knew if she decided to fight, she would be fighting a losing battle since the husband had made it clear that he was not going to leave Maureen. I hope she is truly happy. Lynn, good job."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray that she found peace in her heart... She doesn't deserve to be in this situation. From the word go Abraham was so clear no matter what you choose I will remai with Maureen.Serah may you be happy again
q4sWUJxjc4g,That is truly Sarah dint like all this it normal she was very painful 😓 but no choice trying and keep his husband
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel the same she’s still hurt I feel like she’s just suppressing her emotions. I think she’s was afraid of losing she has worked for and for some reasons I tend to believe Abraham loves moreen more . Anyway I wish them well though. Truth be told she’s a woman forced by circumstances.
q4sWUJxjc4g,😊😊well said
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@lindah9132 true the man loves Maureen more,he told her Maureen is not going anywhere."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤪🤪🤪🤪Been there I know!!! Mmmmm
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wah I think Sarah alikosa tu otherwise woi
q4sWUJxjc4g,For me it's a No if am not enough for you and if you have to choose choose the other one
q4sWUJxjc4g,So what if moureen said if she has to be in your life serah must go..what could have happened to serah???ooh My God😭😭you dont really love serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He is way better than some men we have out here☺️ but the ladies are Phenomenal and I Love their level of maturity alot. Lovely Ladies,God guide them all."

q4sWUJxjc4g,I listen this in another platform and I was in good  terms with my husband it didn't come to me the way it is now that we are not in good terms and I know how it feels you can only accept because of situation
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What I will just tell Abraham is,,,, wacha Kila mtu akue na nyumba yake, this things wake kuka kwa nyumba Moja haileti shangwe, unawaona kama wanapendanya but deep inside u never know, let them have some space"

q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't comment a lot but this one is a no. Serah is definitely suffering but taking it in stride.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeeeh hii siwezi Ata kwa dawa😏😔😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I strongly believe Abraham is not honest there's no way one can share love love has and will never be shared the only love that can be is Agape love I believe Sarah is hating inside Moureen is death for the word of says who ever comes between two who are joined is death the word of God say man shall love his parents jion with his wife and they will be one not with (Wives) if Abraham admired Moureen at very young stage of marriage then he is not an honest man and he will even go for a pango wa kando
q4sWUJxjc4g,If they are happy who are we?  I think this world has alot for us to think of even having time to criticize them.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen found out this guy is married way before she got a child with him, said she didn't picture herself as a second wife but still ended up getting pregnant knowingly wow this makes me sick,as in is it hard to say no to a married man. Those polygamous families that the man opens up to the wife first way before going to look for a second wife is more reasonable than this type of ""cheating"" then ""let accept and live together""."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He went a head to cheat so as serah cud leave..

q4sWUJxjc4g,"For those who say that this story has no message to impact lives, tell me during our great grandfather's time how many single mother's were out here?

Happy for those kids!"

q4sWUJxjc4g,serah is more beautiful.....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wee hi nayo ni ngumu ata kuwatch.....coz me am not allowing another woman in my house...my opinion ✌️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"They all look happy happy but if husband loved Cerah he would have been willing to let go of Maureen but nope he was willing to take a risk to keep Maureen, You can’t love two people the same way never ever, Cerah was not the Type to put her foot down so Abraham  took advantage of that calm spirit. Abraham letting go of Maureen did not mean abandoning your child, he could have taken care of his child without bribing Maureen into the mix of his marriage. The man is having a good time it’s the women who will suffer silently

Maureen is not going anywhere she gained it’s Cerah who lost a husband to another woman so let’s talk about her being the extraordinary person in this equation, we have many Maureen’s but few Cerahs

Maureen that’s why we have visitation rights you don’t have to be a second wife 

Cerah you are a Queen keep reigning sometimes a king wonders off but the Queen mother Keeps the family stable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I almost cried watching these, real emotions, real betrayal and a man who lost love and gained one but wants to maintain his reputation. When he said you look at things beyond love. Now I get there's love lost"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said. This man doesn't love Sera anymore but wants to maintain his reputation. Sera is a beautiful soul she doesn't deserve this.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There was definitely a love lost, poor Sarah she is just putting up this front bcos she has no choice. If he loved Sarah that much he wont get involved as early as he did in his relationship with her. He is ""loving"" her now bcos she made it easy for him to bring in Maureen without a fight. I bet you if Sarah had decided to leave he wouldn't give a hute bcos Maureen is the one he loves. They will be fine"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I've learnt to agree how pple decide to live their lives. I wish them all the best in the world
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thought I'm the only one who got that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Same case with me here...I almost cried, especially when Serah is talking... she's just cool Hana maneno..anakaa very mature..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who else is seeing beauty in serah💕💕💕💕
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very beautiful and calm
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah fears to start all over again..she has kids for the man and the kids have a strong relationship with their father so she has opted to sacrifice her worth and the love she deserves so that her kids cannot be hurt....so sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good friends indeed for me sera should have let her keep him
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ohh Lynn you are so spot on with your questions. The minute his wife confronted him about Maureen he never assured her of his love for her.. Yhoo I feel like crying on her behalf. This is so sad women sometimes they subject themselves to pain Hai. No matter how kind hearted Maureen is it will never be OK for what she and this man did to this wonderful Sera. Now this man is imposing his will on her by bringing her into her house. Hey human being like to complecate things maan. When you make a concious decision to marry someone please note that you ""Must "" deny yourself for the well being of your partner no matter what you feel. The heart is a deceiver and what it desire leads to death."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What sort of nonsence is this ,anataka kufinya serah atoke,serah jipange"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is it only me noticing the resemblance between the two ladies?Also wondering why they both use his first name Abraham as their surname but not Mwangi...
Anyway,the friendship or polyamorous relationship is just complicating life......all rosy now but we shall revisit.😥😥😥🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,For me if I were serah I won't accept to live in the same  house....because that will make Abraham to have a room to get even a third wife.my opinion though....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As the saying goes, you’re not married until you’re married (officially). Sex is not marriage. Marry before having sex to avoid unnecessary situations. You can start again purely than settling for such things.otherwise this isn’t supported. This msg is not for everyone though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The carpet says it all. Discussing the elephant 🐘 in the room
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If he was honest,he wouldn't  have waited that long to tell the first wife? Why wait for her to be deep into to it, she stayed because she loved  you so deep and she had made a life with you.

Maureen I am Maureen too,but I wish you could have put yourself  in Serah's  shoes.  Anyway  all the best to you all."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If they are happy I wish them all the best, but mimi sigwesi"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder what is being modeled to the kids and if he would be as happy with his daughter being a second wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sanitising infidelity...not my cup of tea ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Anyone coming in between a couple is death....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen,be courageous,leave this marriage and get your own husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,As for me I can't pretend to be okay...I was to be a second wife but after soul searching I realized the other one hearts alot .. Better wait upon the lord ... nothing like friendship love is jealous.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man is a very selfish man , I got upset listening to this."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thanks Lynn for bringing this interview, they are still young with young Kids,  Abraham should put every woman in her own house. As time goes thy might crush."

Aaaand Maureen sharaaaap!!"" I was genuinely concerned"" n you were still with him blaaaaah..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah is hurt and who do we blame but the second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moral of the story
1. The more calm and tolerant you are the more people will shit on your head.
2. The more you give the more will be taken from you until you have nothing left.
3. Weka fasi. Tafuta fasi. Funga fasi.ingia kwa fasi."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you forgot to ask for us who sits in the front seat when the husband is driving 🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah wewe ni mbrave sana,pee watu chance mpaka waboeke,utabaki peke yako na bibi siku  moja"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sickening😬😬
q4sWUJxjc4g,Please stop saying ths is God's doing coz you cheated on your wife had a baby outside marriage when ur wife found out that's when u opened up but you were living in sin . Jus becoz your first wife understood you and she clearly had no choice coz u told her you love the other woman that doesn't mean God was in it . The correct way to put your situation is the 3 of you had an understanding and leave God's name out of ths.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mbona umekasirika hivi.. keep calm😂😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree with you, this is not God's doing. God never contradicts himself. People need to read and understand the word of God."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you for telling them the truth this is pure adultery and God is far from it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Dr ttytty 6 to go hi yes you v hi boo boo boo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes,many people associates sin with God He's holy.How can a man love two women? This is lust"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think if I heard that from my guy after I  have seen the photos I would never trust him,  but the fact that he brought you home its a sign that he is trustworthy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not happy shez just forcing a smile coz hana choice
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Looks to me like Sera was coerced, not a willing participant in this three-some!!! 🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Also because this is a selfish man He will still  cheat if he isn't already cheating 🙄
q4sWUJxjc4g,3rd wife loading
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am very sure if Sara n Maureen hawengekuwa  wanakaa same house Abraham angekua amechoka Maureen coz she's not a homemaker  ni wakudandia goodies

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I Love how Lynn ask questions 
I pray that cerah finds peace and and she should know that her worth and identity are in Christ not man
She is not okay her body language says it all"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel this is narcissistic of the man but anyway, I guess some women don't mind settling for less"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"too much lies Maureen......Serah is still hurting inside....maureen you did wrong as you knew clearly this is a married man. Abraham at some point the truth is gonna come out. The end is not goin to be so good. Serah May God heal your heart, you have a very strong heart."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham  indeed is the father of all Nations.
If they are Christians then:
(Only death  can separate what God has put together)

q4sWUJxjc4g,"For Serah,she had no choice and she settled to share. She is a beautiful lady, may be she eventually found out that she was married to a polygamous man in nature and had no option. Good for them if they pull thro' this in Years to come. I wish them well. For me it's either me or her no sharing, no nooo. I hope there will not be no. 3 and 4...."

Sarah you stood too low 😂

You may lie us your okay but if you have your own money you can't take all these lubbish.

What am i even says money runs the world"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have never watched/ heard of a polygamous family where the 1st wife is empowered / independent financially.
Parents, please empower your girl child!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Then you still have to do more research.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly. She would have left if she had her own wealth. She knows she has more to lose than to gain if she leaves
q4sWUJxjc4g,Say that one more  time..

q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't see any big issue here.my grandfather had 4 wives and they lived happily cz I know all of them. Abrahams story is not something new.i better accept my co-wife rather than die a premature death due to depression and ulcers
q4sWUJxjc4g,God bless them actually is better being  in polygamous  marriage than suffering alone out there..  what matters is happiness in life don't forget our ancestors were polygamous  as afro- descendants I think we should follow the footsteps of our ancestors  we have one  life so live it
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy has NEVER been ordained by God. Stop comforting them! It is sinful and always has wrangles.
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@millicentaswata3907 how many great men of God in that bible who had as many wives as they disered and yet according to scriptures there was nothing wrong were they serving the same God we serve my question o...    For  me Polygamy is better than  u know it already.. do what makes you happy and leave the rest to God to judge
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@annastaciamweni3076 that is your opinion which of course is SURBSERVIENT TO GOD'S SUPREME WORD/LAW. The craving of men for sin WILL NEVER ALTER GOD'S WORD. Even common sense tells you that polygamy never works. Ni pretence tu. DID GOD CREATE TWO WOMEN FOR ADAM? Oh come on! Ask Sarah why she couldn't put up with Hagar. Have you considered Jacob and all his wives. He only acknowledged and truly loved Rachel.The others walimzalia tu.  

Finally, God gives us free will to choose good or evil. But you pay for the consequences. Being given a free will doesn't mean God condones sin. Blessings"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@annastaciamweni3076 God gives people a free will to choose evil or good. Do you mean to say that God changed His law? CERTAINLY NOT! Blessings. please dont struggle too much to justify sexual sin (polygamy). If you are in a polygamous union, that is your choice and God will not eject you out of it forceful. Be at peace and choose what fits you plus its consequences. Blessings"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceera has a pure heart.i love how calm and wise she is.peace and happiness is what I wish her🌹🥰🥰
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The husband took advantage of that pure heart and brought another woman home. If she was tougher, he’d not have dared."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@blessedwachera7133 aki wanaume😭😭😭.but let's wish them all the best in their lives 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,I really pity Cerah as well 😩😩😩😩😩
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Great interview
I don't get why watu wanatry kuwa judge, let God do that, we all have our beliefs. Why are people insisting that serah is unhappy, if she says she is what makes you feel you know her  more than she knows herself. Wacha watu wakae maisha Yao how they choose to. We out here judging and we are in worse situations. Learn to respect people's choices, we are in the 21st century."
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Serah is such a good woman in your life then why was she not ENOUGH
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It,s their choose,but I cannot support"
q4sWUJxjc4g,They're just thinking about themselves but what about the kids.. What are they teaching their kids?? This is disgusting. I pity the kids
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sasa watoto wanaonanga baba yao leo kwa hii bedroom kesho kwa ile ingine??how shameful
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy has a type they somehow look alike
q4sWUJxjc4g,Anyway I am glad they are living in harmony and the ladies found friendship in each other
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is just wrong. Sometimes  women are left with No  choice  if it was the husband will he be happy if his wife took a second man .Because  the bible says do unto others as you want them to do unto you.The fact that the man changed towards sarah tells a lot
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mimi nmewawatch NTV metha ya kagoni,but I'll watch again"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's this bitter pill we all need to swallow...any polygamous man  or any woman accepting to be an additional wife is outrightly SELFISH...I hate it!...I will walk out if my husband brings another wife... there's nothing Maurine is offering that Serah can't....the most hurting bit is that Serah and Abraham started from scratch n she probably cannot stand losing all that to an intruder, hence she has to join the people she can't fight...she loves kids n she couldn't let Maurine's kid with Abraham suffer...poor girl 😥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am also sure Abraham and Cerah started from scratch but vile kapesa kameingia the man humiliates Cerah instead ata amlift to the highest level
q4sWUJxjc4g,She’s lying..
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy is an opportunist...he played on Serah's vulnerabilities. My goodness! He doesn't even let the ladies answer questions posed to them. What happens when he wants a 3rd wife? I have found this whole interview infuriating but it's their lives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""They are mine"", ""Abraham's Empire""...how would he feel if his wives wanted second husband's. This is all so nonsensical to me but like they say to each their own."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Narcissistic
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very infuriating
q4sWUJxjc4g,"He’s such a narcissist too. I hate men who interrupt women when talking. 
I’m glad I’m not the only one noticing this."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Dnt4kwtm yes a classic narc
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Nonesense we also blame immorality in men but as a woman can you say NO to a married man,,,,pthoo"

q4sWUJxjc4g,The union lool when I grow up I want this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah reminds me of me,  Serah used wisdom because apparently Abraham had made up his mind on Maureen. Serah made it really really easy for Abraham , otherwise it would be a different story now.  Abraham should hold Serah with such high esteem and Maureen should love and thank God for   Serah's graceful character.  Men have more than 1 wife the one who is known, and many others they hide"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is younger and more beautiful than Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who loves to share their partner? I would not appreciate that kind of arrangement esp when GOD only created one woman out of the man's rib. I feel Cera is patient considering she is a mother and maybe naturally kind hearted. Lakini Abraham made a selfish mistake. (kumbe men can live with huge secrets?? Mungu nifunze wisdom and am learning not to tell my stuff fully)  Especially on him keeping Maureen could it be a selfish decision to grow his business because he talks about these women being so enterprising...and Serah is calm as long as all children  are getting the comfort while they sees where it's headed or working on exit plans. That is Sera's marriage, wisdom Kwanza before she leaves her marriage in haste. Abraham has power to choose whom to keep. Maureen also did not want her child raised away from her and could she ever overturn the wealth of this family now that she works closely to Abraham? I pray that they do not deal wickedly with each other  because of family wealth. Anyway I am still trying to understand them without harsh judgement. It took some time for Hagar to disrespect Sarah and she was sent back to Abraham's household but with a blessing like a curse Ishmael generation was wild. But I care for how they will raise children that understand this is not a normal marriage. This issues cause secret pain in the adults and children involved or rather shame. Am impressed at their respect, joy and seeming friendship."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People will always try to see what will make them happy and understand better. By saying Serah is hurting etc. Yet she accepted from the get go. If she did not angechukia the fellow woman as other women do. Stop trying to create a narrative for yourself. They are doing something different but it works for them. Me am married, but I love this for them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story has impacted me in a way that I'm asking for kilimani bosses since they love each other so much do they have THREE-SOME🤣🤣🤣????
q4sWUJxjc4g,I want to know too
q4sWUJxjc4g,My family is polygamous the shitty kind i hateeeee the second wife coz the pain she caused us is immense buh i think the man draws the line the second shld be unselfish the first should be sane like cera may you make it.......
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Its Sarah's words for me "" i have never been lucky before, i am not a lucky person""...its kind of hurting coz when she found her luck (abraham) ,  abraham brought in another woman in their lives. Is that still luck? But who am i to judge! She is the only one who knows the real truth about how she feels about this union...if she is happy, well and good.
God, this is not my portion."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I dont think this is a true Love.No man can love two women at the same time,There must be one who will feel less loved.This is too dangerous and at the end of this, dont play with women."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Time will tell  whether you guys will stick together coz Sarah's body language speaks otherwise...also the guy is too much in love with moreen according to how he's expressing how she is...this is crazy...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aky I don't like Maureen si chuki  but her vibe is not right.....she even looks older than serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All this nonsense of the first wife having no choice is pure bullshit, she still has a choice to leave even now. It's time people stopped judging situations negativity. Something's in life are destined to happen 😲."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I feel for Sarah, she had no choice but to accept akijua mahali wametoka, but men why why? 😭😭😭It's so heartbreaking you start with someone from zero then when you make it he gets a second wife. Sarah may God continue giving you grace."

q4sWUJxjc4g,All I can see is a one happy family..cera Ni mkimya Maureen is a talkertive one so watu wakusema anavumilia apo sioni mm aliamua na akamkaribisha
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This beautiful and am soo happy for the understanding b2n the two ladies,soo wacheni kurusha mawe cz they decided to do this just wish them all the best and luck kwa life yao,am proud of you guys❤❤❤Abraham congrats for been fatherly to your kids,and not abordoning them,not unlike wale men huleft their kids ,I appreciate u sana,and Lynee our beloved journalist I love you and proud of your work😘😘😘😘"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"What if the 1st wife does the same,finds another man n decides she is still keeping father Abraham,atakubali?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,😏😏 cant stay here watch this nonsense this is total support adultery  people got no shame anymore you come out in camera and brag how you got two women😭 indeed these are the end times jesus come back take us please this world became devils play ground
q4sWUJxjc4g,The guy loves Maureen so much. Cera ni 3rd wheeler tu who loved a man so deeply she had no option but stay.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People lets stop making all these crazy insinuations, they seem ok together as odd as it is. But to each their own. Serah is an amazing accepting,kind and calm woman. God bless your heart, a woman with a heart of gold. Most women couldn't have handled this the way you did though I believe you deserve so much more. I wish you happiness you're amazing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Indeed Gods grace is sufficient,sera is anice woman,calm and understanding"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Their is no medol for accepting abuse.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kenyans are the most hypocritical people , ati you can't love two people, l love how Abraham has answered that question. I admire this family and both ladies are beautiful and unique in their own ways. People are very quick to criticize and hate on that which they know about. Maureen you are not a home wrecker and Serah, you are a wise strong and very beautiful lady. May your empire grow"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Weueh the comments here are hooot.
Me if you bring in another one,it means you are obviously tired of me,I will leave."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Shame shame shame on you Maureen how can you do this to a fellow woman.You have betrayed all the women.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera will see God
q4sWUJxjc4g,The other side of polygamy is the women also have boyfriends. Una fikiria Sera aki katiwa huko nje ata kataa?  She may not leave the marriage but ata kuwa na mtu on the side.  Infact most Africans cultures accepted that .  Ndio maana maasai mtu ufunga mshale kwa Mlango aki tembelea bibi wako.   Polygamy is an open relationship for all.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wonder what's that Serah didn't have that Abraham had to get it from Maureen. Theirs is a special case, Lynn I love how you dig so deep in a very polite manner."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kachungwa amejibleach kweli kweli 🤣the first lady is beautiful 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Uyo dem n mweupe naturally
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I'm in between the convos and in as much as I respect their perception on family and relatiou, I think it was selfish of Abraham to vibe someone else when she has just delivered.... he was supposed to be there for his wife during that time... I mean it was their first child..... I think Serah is just a good person and she figured her way through the pain just to have some peace of mind, but that was unfair in a ways"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I find the husband to be dishonest. He is not answering difficult questions and he has signs of cheating on both wives
q4sWUJxjc4g,"notice he says ""how i would respond to that"" 
not honest"
q4sWUJxjc4g,But Kuna mahali Kwa metha ya gokoni cerh said that Abraham alikuwa amemushow atawai get a second wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pesa isikose hapa....money is the glue here
q4sWUJxjc4g,I will say this is NONSENSE a millions times. Trust me this guy is sick.
q4sWUJxjc4g,However much they try to act okay....one of the ladies will never be happy and that mostly will affect the one who was betrayed and that is cera
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynne ngugi you are awesome watching from 🇺🇸 keep on working  hard 💪 ❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,If one day Sarah decides to walk out. We need to support her. I feel like she has no option and she also has kids to raise.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel the same....God help her
q4sWUJxjc4g,Iam not liking her calmness it might be eating her up or a bomb in making
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is the main reason why women don't leave 😥😢😢it's so 😢 sad. Serah has a pure heart. Huyu naona akileta bibi mwingine, he sounds so like a controller 😭😥"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This comment should be pinned📌🤧
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes I walked out of my marriage with three kids after my husband was clear he wanted to bring another wife and God is faithful 8 yrs later iam happily married with the 3kids and my ex still moving from one lady to another. But I always blame the parents especially of the guy they should teach him well
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki Lynn you never disappoint,, I have been waiting this interview from Lynn  👏👏👏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,so now we are parading adultery like a trophy? okay guess y'all gonna leave me behind because I am not boarding this train.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Abraham's nitafutieni job huko kwa accessories......
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't usually comment on YouTube videos but today am ""unable to can"" From a Christian perspective it's a definite no and beyond that, I can say that all you three adults in the name of Adam, Cerah and Maureen are very selfish. Did you ever take into consideration how your kids will be affected and believe you me it is not that rosy, right now they are young and can't comprehend but they will grow up in this society where you will not be able to shield them anymore. This will affect them for the rest of their lives and not in a good way. I am speaking from experience as a grown up, long past dad slept it still affects us to date. You have set your kids up with issues beyond their control and it really isn't fair on them. It's sad what our society has become in the name of being politically correct, woke and going ahead to disregard what you know deep in your heart is wrong, proof being you both found it difficult to open up to Cerah about the relationship from the onset. This is not over, no, not by a long shot my people, there are always consequences to our actions forgiveness not withstanding. I can only wish you the best."
q4sWUJxjc4g,All about this man is 💰 nothing else
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man's Audacity eeeh nkt
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeeh 😟
q4sWUJxjc4g,How do they sleep
q4sWUJxjc4g,I was wondering where Lynne is. But woooo thank God I have the taste of this story using Lynne version. Congratulations 🎊 gal for that.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The absolute ghetto!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,chungeni this man ameona akuna mtu anamshtua anaweza ongeza no 3
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Ooh 😊 i admire you guys, as long as there is Peace and love ❤️❤️ wish you all the best 🥰🙏🏾🙏🏾"
q4sWUJxjc4g,So sad 🥺🥺 I see pain in serah's eye's.she is heartbroken.from this interview Abraham's soulmate is Maureen n serah is just a cleaner
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hehehehe
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yaani im hurt while watching this!!!To moureen have you ever put yourself on Cerahs shoes ???
How would feel ?
Karma is a bitch darling"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen, watch out so God!s wrath does not find you...God fights for calm individuals like sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Your kids will pay the price you Mumu of a man. As long as Sarah is hurting it shall never be well ata mkijifanya. The second has even started getting moody for no reason. Just wait, it’s a matter of time."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am from South Africa and I really enjoy this channel. I wish admin can include subtitles for none Kenyans. The YT one is not picking up your language
q4sWUJxjc4g,I share your sentiment. more often than not We miss a lot
q4sWUJxjc4g,When Love isn't Love anymore.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You are professional 👏 👌 to the maximum.  Kudos to you and your team as you take a non judgemental approach to every situation. In my next life, I want to have 2 husbands openly but hardly think it would work in our society and especially for women.  Well, it's better than being the sidechick and they are open about it. .As usual you are looking fabulous in your summery outfit. Elegance at its 👌 to suit every occasion.  Please interview a woman who has 2 husbands so we can see how the different genders treat the spouse sharing in the same home or otherwise.  All the best to you and your team as you continue to share very interesting life experiences with your global audience."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen came to ruin that marriage trust me you will pay for it...Sarah uzizae tena pls
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I watched their interview on another channel, but this time round I enjoy it more coz of the pressing questions Lynn is asking. Anyone can see for a fact that Sera was not in a position to do anything but agree to her husband's decision. It's never easy for a wife to accept the fact that there's another woman in her husband's life. But anyway if they say they're happy who I am I to question.🤷 But what moreen and Abraham did is so wrong in so many levels. All the best to this family. Hope they know what they're doing."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen is now changing her story from I knew Abraham was married to  i never knew , she was heart broken yet yeye anavunja ya maureen, wewe soon unatoka uwachie sara kwake"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thank you Lynn for fixing this three confused grown ups ,from here now you will see things changing"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is a destroyer all those questions you could have had before opening your legs to get the baby
q4sWUJxjc4g,Na wanafanana
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let’s wait for him to get a third wife..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The interview has been soo intense and different from Lynn.Big up girl.I feel this story is all based on self Indentity\worth /childhood trauma,but ni life"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree with you i shed tears when ceera said she has never bin lucky ....and when her father's reation when she got married tells alot about her background
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii ya Leo it's a tough one,not to compare but it's better than a man cheating with another dude in marriage"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Usiongese mwanamuke tena bwana, umeskia?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish them well
q4sWUJxjc4g,I am so hurt because some of us want to assume that Serah never felt any pain. Yes she accepted Maureen and she deliberately welcomed her. Not because she wanted a co-wife but because it was her husband's decision which she could not change. Remember the first time she confronted Abraham? She shed tears. Why? Because she was in deep pain. Women stay in such marriages because of many reasons. Her's is love. She loves Abraham so much. Good that she has learned to live with it but the truth is; What Abraham and Maurine did is wrong and painful. They should live knowing that they caused Serah so much pain. Is just that Serah is a strong calm woman with a Golden heart and is blessed with the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation. A man cannot love two women equally. Watch keenly. Abraham is leaning more towards Maurine. Serah didn't deserve this.Mimi nimesema. Great Interview Lynn.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not your business.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I really agree with you and on this interview you can serah is not happy at all,being a human I can't be ok with this,it really hurts,maybe kuvumilia tu.Anyway ,am not judging though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aki mimi  ningeenda  kabisa without  looking  back  lmagine you are at home taking care of the baby  and he is out there  asking women out instead of you  how painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My opinion is that Serah has a big heart, so big to accommodate her co wife. But I think she is suppressing her emotions. From the look of things Abraham loves Maureen more than Serah. Maybe it's   a case of the new broom sweeping well but not forgetting that the old broom knows all the corners"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@thandiwemseteka3963 😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kuna details wameruka
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So sorry for Cerah , may God make a way for you.God is faithful.
To moureen,One day you will pay for Cerahs tears.Mwanaume ni mwanaume"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy here respects  both wives . My story was hell. My Ex Husband was a devil , the problem was he favored the other woman coz she was an alcoholic and abusive as he was. Just because they fight when drunk, he does the same to me yet I don't take alcohol.  She used to like it when that man was a abusive towards me. Mimi sahio I'm just calm and minding my business. To an extent of comparing me to her that I'm boring, coz my kind of fun is different.  I left that man for her. Mimi nilitoka."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"All the three are living a lie.  Please stay true to yourselves!  It doesn't inspire anyone!!!!  It's just dishonesty and disrespect that is tolerated.  It's unacceptable,  what are we telling our young generation.??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can Father Abraham also accept if Cerah  finds true love to join the loop...AFRICANS...YIKES
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its how lynn asks her questions 😊
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen selfish as well. I dont know if she was the first wife would she have entertained?


Cera
You have a beautiful life aside of these two people. Face yourself. I know you will never be the same 

This wont end well"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham i find selfish and actually its the  ladies who worked the thing out. Hes a coward as well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From what I have witnessed, polygamous relationships never work out in the long run and a lot of hurt is caused along the way. I really hope Sarah sees the light soon and leave this toxic situation. She's a very beautiful woman who will have no trouble at all finding a new man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,So you think there are mad men outside here who will take care your through children whom they have no idea who their fathers are?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@mgtvnews6890 thankfully not all men think like you and there are some good men out there. My sibling and I were lovingly raised by our stepfather, to us he's simply our dad. Now he's reaping the rewards of his kindness because we take good care of him together with our mum. Although our biological father is still alive, we've got no relationship with him."
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@fifitakapisa he can never be your father boss no matter how good you sugar coat it
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@mgtvnews6890 kuzaa sio kazi kulea ndio kazi na mlezi ndio wa maana zaidi
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@terryannmwendwa3834 what if your mother cheated on your real dad? Seems you were poisoned by your mother to hate your real dad but the facts remains he is the real dad. Yeye ndio alimwanga ndani otherwise haungekuwa ukicomment hapa 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,The first wife looks so unhappy but trying to pretend like she it’s ok but you can see it one day they will kill each other I have seen it somewhere but it’s ended by death
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ndigehota 🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,So if it's Sarah who decided to have a second husband would have Abraham agreed and stayed in the marraige.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sugar coating sin
q4sWUJxjc4g,I just love Lynn  you always ask the right questions
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Towards the end when Serah talks to the husband one one one and he gets emotional, it's clear they haven't had a heart to heart talk in a long time. Her relationship with the husband has been very mechanical. But her presence also strains the relationship between the husband and the second wife who is very emotionally needy. At the end of the day, none of the three is totally happy to be married. Kila mmoja wao anapambana na hali yake😥 Serah is no angel, she played the card of ""keep your enemies closest"" perfectly!."
q4sWUJxjc4g,you are very right
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wow! Wisdom right here!
q4sWUJxjc4g,I Gerrit
q4sWUJxjc4g,Selfish man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wisdom detected
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wee! Abraham tu ange akibaki na sarah
q4sWUJxjc4g,For me as Cerah...this can be a great pass to ALSO find love AGAIN...hey...freedom
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham will u like one day ua son to be like u?? What about your daughters to be married like your wives???
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Definitely a third and fourth wife might come,men are men,...may God bless sera"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There's no woman under this planet who will feel ok with having a co-wife,anyway wish them well,still it needs strong hearted ladies to connect when they share a man"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true no one would wish this nonsense
q4sWUJxjc4g,IMGN AS first wife in ua bedroom knowing that next bedroom is ua husband with another woman it's Soo painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,IMGN AS first wife in ua bedroom knowing that next bedroom is ua husband with another woman it's Soo painful
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wht I HV seen here is God's grace and total respect
q4sWUJxjc4g,Fourteen of US  were brought up in the same setting and we all turned out OK.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I bet you belong to the second family
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@sophieachieng498 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I've really cackled at your statement
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@sophieachieng498 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💔💔💔
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I try not to judge people and their choices, but same house??"
q4sWUJxjc4g,i think sera and moureen are in love with  each other .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wueh, ata mseme nini... I see pain, paiiiiiiiiin"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Be careful what you name your kids....Abraham...
q4sWUJxjc4g,""" I avoided this conversation for long because I never wanted to loss her in my life"" did you stop to think that you might have lost Cerah in the process? Or didn't fear losing her?

The fact that you left Cerah for Maureen showed that your love shifted and that can never be same again...and the fact that you said that you looked for small things like Cerah not giving you attention just to get an excuse to vibe Maureen? 

The way you broke the news to her what options did you leave Cerah with? By the grace of God I had to accept that"" Cerah may that grace of God keep you mama!

Maureen all  those questions about what Cerah would say do or react  would have bothered you before you got the baby. You saw Abraham's status him posting the baby's picture, then you went ahead and had a  baby!

Maureen, if you ever read this I hope you will keep smiling when Abraham brings in a third wife who is an entrepreneur, focused just a little better than you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Honestly speaking,,,,, this one is hitting me very very hard"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wah first  wife very pretty  .second ..no noo looks old
q4sWUJxjc4g,This lady Lynn maswali are sweet and direct 😋 haha
q4sWUJxjc4g,haki Lynn na mchene .🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 who is yr teacher
q4sWUJxjc4g,I respect Abraham as a man. To manage 2 women in the same house. It's the wisdom that he has. He can speak his way out of a tough situation and come out victorious. Most men have lots of side chicks and kids left to grow without father being present. l respect him for that.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Tru tru tru this one is beta than those who have many women left right centre and kids all over who thy dont take care of.....so huyu ni beta 101%
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@gwg216 What gives...that he doesn't have them?He got his side pregnant, remember?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly my sentiments! This is way much better than endless mipangos and kids growing up without fathers or father figures resulting to a lost society.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham I can't judge you, 
Being a Man I can't raise a finger to you or your family for 
1. You've come out loud on this matter, people are doing it in secret and judge in public. 
2. Kindly love them equal esp your first wife, she's so Cool and please get more closer to her, it seems you more to Moureen than to her, she gave her space and allowed her to share her husband, what if it was Moureen who came first, would she has given chance to her? 
3. Lastly but not least, You got both meat and greens on the same plate, it's a balanced diet, I wonder what you'll go out looking for again..
All the best 💪💪👏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I will not glorify immorality!!!
Serah isn't happy at all. Shetani ashindwe mfurulizo. Ngai muthenya ta uyu ndahoya gwakwa ndukanakie🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This father Abraham will bring a 3rd wife in the name of she is entrepreneur
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lemi tell you maina .this is madness. To serah she is beautiful for that .women are naturally jealous amd with this one of them is hurting...kwa camera u can lie but not to yourself....to Maureen u came and confused this family. And to myself I will never accept a second wife .akikuja natoka ivo siku...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera am proud of you gal, leave everything to God and you will see His wonders, and because the Holy Bible says clearly that a man leave his parents and unite with his wife and not wives, may God favour you gal in Every second of you life and your children too, may the amazing grace that comes when one endures some deep pains be showered in you gal. I just love the wisdom and knowledge God has blessed  you with of handling situations."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Bible says that a mistake can never be justified no matter what before the eyes of the Lord.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham started seeing  maureen after serah was not giving much time for him....lakini men must you always justify your sin
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah she is beautiful...the other lady she is very old...atakayeingililia kati ya wawili waliopendana  atakuwa kifo!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is just a show, don't pretend, there's no transparency ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,woiiee I'm not judging but more grace to Cera. You can literally see pain through her cute smile.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Someone had nowhere to go.Its simple and clear
q4sWUJxjc4g,One is not enough he will just cheat on you that's the reallest of all it's better for him to have two and you know
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is a strong woman. If she has the grace its ok.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is wise
q4sWUJxjc4g,Morine if you have to sin to get it then know it's not a blessing morine think about the man who was kept for you  because if Abraham was yours God couldn't Sarah to be in his life so run for your life because God's time will surely ripe  and when it will you will wake up one day and leave the house with only a hand bag let me tell you
q4sWUJxjc4g,He is boisterous and cruel! Cera was never given a choice. By the way Maureen number 3 is coming. Then you will know how Cerah is feeling. Cera was not given a chance to grieve the death of the husband she knew. He was happy and didn't care how she felt for as long as he is happy. Narcism is real. Girls be ware.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love was created for two souls and only two hearts. It can't be shared. It can never be equal. Period.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Is it only me noticing the resemblance between the two ladies?Also wondering why they both use his first name Abraham as their surname but not Mwangi...
Anyway,the friendship or polyamorous relationship is just complicating life......all rosy now but we shall revisit.😥😥😥🤔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Who told you that,walami?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,True.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@thenewbykrew they don't resemble,Maureen is browner,but beauty lies in eyes of beholder,Sarah hs a good heart may GOD see her through not easy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It got me deep when serah said "" As a woman,it's not easy"" anyway all the best to the Abrahams ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's how he answered that love question for me🤦🤦 So this works perfectly for Father Abraham but did anyone truly and honestly ask Sarah if this was ok by her?  Is she happy? Was she just expected to accept it, be strong, smile through it, build a friendship with the second wife? Yes? No?  Her body language speaks volumes.

Today, I will not glorify infidelity, cheating or  polygamy. If they are all truly happy then by all means thumbs up👍👍 but what I will say is that if a husband loves the wife enough.... just like God willed it to be, he (the husband) would lay down his life for her rather than disrespect her then expect her to live through it all with a smile. Bringing another woman in showed that Sarah wasn't woman enough for you 🤦

That's my unwarranted two cents How you decipher my comment is up to you."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I  💯 agree with you.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree with you..You can't betray someone you love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,They can try to justify it all they can but one person among them is definitely not happy however much they claim to be.
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are very right
q4sWUJxjc4g,True 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii ni ndoa gani kwani? Maana kwa Christians hii haipo au ipo Kenya tu? Guys hawa watu wanajidanganya hakuna kitu kama hii kiukweli. As much as i know women kuna bomu liko mbele trust me.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Definitely the first wife must feel a kind of way, but it is what it is, but don't you guys think it's better for your man to be honest with the first wife rather than hide, which let's say the truth,  majority of men in this country practice polygamy  hiding, at least Abraham  is honest that he has 2 wives  so better the things done in light than darkness.  As for me I support this relationship"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"THESE LADIES ARE SO MATURE.
IF KENYAN LADIES CAN BE  ROLE MODELLED BY THESE TWO."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If they are happy  that's good , Abraham is not the first man to have two wives polygamous  is everywhere from the Bible too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen  kamezeeka uso
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ati Abraham her case positively Maureen's .....I will say Sarah has been choiceless it's only u found your soulmate kwa Maureen.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s hurts me even watching this..I can’t imagine being Sarah 😟
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn you should ask Abraham if it would be okay for one of his wives to bring in another husband. Sasa, who are you guys trying to decieve?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😄 🤣 😂 😆 😄  and they share  that man too
q4sWUJxjc4g,"women know men are scarce-yes responsible men, but here most of the naysayers are women. kweli women are their own worst enemies. the fact is polygamy is becoming popular and no one can stop that. most women are in polygamy settings and are in denial. lets face the reality and embrace this ""necessary evil"". single motherhood is on the rise, fatherlessness is a big problem too. the society should accept this way of life and we move on. its so simple."
q4sWUJxjc4g,What if he fall inlove with the 3rd woman?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just yesterday I saw on YouTube, some guy said '""i have utmost respect for Muslims, even though I am no muslim because Muslims follow their laws to the latter, they are not two sided about what they stand for but christians have loads of double standards, a gay christian will feel the need to defend sin be very entitled, a Christian polygamous man will feel the need to justify his adultery yet it is in writing there with. Blasphemy for Muslims is a big deal but we christians can go anywhere and be anything but christians'"" 
and I felt like that's the best way to look at things
This is not a 'religion thing' but wueeeh it's the kids that will feel the strength of the wave the most."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Basi si waishi nyumba seperate, hii kuishi nyumba same..hmmmm...,maureen ati i knew he was married,Leo she says i dint know he was married..waah..mimi though 2nd wives zii..never."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I watched this interview on a different platform but was not flowing like this....Oooh Lynn out beautiful gal you are doing an amazing job  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 and much 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 baby gal
q4sWUJxjc4g,So Abraham u mean since u r an entrepreneur n u r still meeting these beautiful ladies what if u happen to meet another gal or gals beautiful n everything ...u will still move in with them coz they have this qualities?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No matter what Maureen feel confident in this thing,
Society will always blame a woman and the day they will broke up,GOD forbid,The society will treat her harshly she better be ready should anything happens."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah don’t look happy at all even though she says she is,, it’s very painful and you can see the pain in her eyes even if she’s smiling, it’s just not nice!! Maureen seems to be more happier than serah 
The first wife always suffer but God will always remember you ,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Madness. How is this even worth an interview for people to watch!!!! Very disgusting, this man cheated on his wife, knew she is dependent on him and brought along this useless gold digger to disrupt everything nkttt!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I watched them somewhere else and Am sure if it was maureen in this situation she wouldn't have agreed to this nonsense. She is so mean.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, what is your plan on succession. If God forbid something happens have you planned for that and  for your kids especially? Whose names are in the title of this house you guys live in. and other properties. Cerah, are you director in the business that Maureen and Abraham run? Maureen are you a director in Cerah's business? Curious"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wonder why sin is supported by this guy's this is wrong in God's eyes (repent)
q4sWUJxjc4g,Finally here is the BIG QUESTION
q4sWUJxjc4g,May it end in premium tears. AMEN
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤦🤦🤣 woiyee
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen to this
q4sWUJxjc4g,Amen 😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kambas say that Kala Ka manyiiye usuna kayulawa. Meaning :-Kidole kimezoea kuramba huwa akiachi. This guy will still go for another one. Sarah is not happy with the whole thing. She is just there bcz of 123. May she find herself and find her inner peace. Maureen is just a husband snacher. She doesn't respect other people's feelings.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"both ladies have good heart,  that's why they're able to live together.  Wivu ndio huwa inaharibu kila kitu. I pray they continue that way, they live in peace and happiness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a joke before my eyes?you can’t even live with your own sis in the same house for a long time without arguing ,what a bout staying with a co wife ,I can’t do this to another fellow woman nor would I allow it to happen to me"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You can't see wivu with your eyes. It it always hidden in those smiles!
q4sWUJxjc4g,You are mistaken
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hapo, I think ata akipata wa tatu he will just marry"
q4sWUJxjc4g,This must be hard for Serah😩
q4sWUJxjc4g,He needs 3 wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mwangi is one real man not like other men pretending to have one wife and ten concubines
q4sWUJxjc4g,This two women are like...tutakaa mwenye atachoka aende....but they are both hurting... moureen looks older because of stress...cera is okay nikujenga mwili but she is not loved
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So my question is if pendo hadn't seen the photos of Maureen and shown cerah ,Cerah would have never known the truth and Maureen bado angekua side chic coz if Abraham wanted to tell cerah the truth he would have told her even bfr Maureen had gotten pregnant"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pesa make water glue
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy vs polyandry- Lynn can we have a polyandry story as well?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Family is a gift from God and Abraham is blessed with a beautiful and peaceful family. May God bless you and keep the fire burning.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Aaaaah.. Kumbe anaitwa Abrahamu... No no questions for you sir 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kibe is watching
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah has a good heart .too bad good hearted people always get cheated and taken advantage of.second wife coming to this marriage it's clear it affected Sarah .she made the greatest mistake allowing the  second wife to live in her home.A wise man should give each wife her home and privacy and future expectations of if death comes who will take care of this current home.....Maureen for the sake of Sarah ask  your husband to give u your own house.its called self respect..messing somebody home will never sugar coated to marriage it's called trespass📌📌
q4sWUJxjc4g,Polygamy is not a sin.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Married lakini hee nyumba moja aiiii never
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sita comment cos only God can see their hearts and if its right to have two wives may the will of God be done.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"swallowing pride isn't fattening seems like something he has brainwashed them into. They are now his victims, he's a narcissist. Polygamy in this day and age is a no no no....You are sleeping with both of them. Why? I wear ironed socks, now they're your slaves they even iron socks lol..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So this story  is supposed to motivate us,?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I like how he says they are both mine 😅🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Woooi Aki cerah .life is too short my dea.try to love your self mamma.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Upuzi tu time is coming
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I wish you asked a very crucial question on finances; do they have a joint account or does Abraham provide for the whole family?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I respect their union .But one thing I've learnt in life ,you can stay in a situation  due to fear of the unknown .Fear of when i move from this that i already know and am used to where do i go next and how will i embrace that which i don't know.For me it looks like that's what got Serah and she had to convince herself to stay where she already knew despite what came her way. Serah if you're truly happy that's a win for you.But please women lets not stay  in situation's because we prioritize our  kids ,the society ,our husbands ,relatives etc and deep down we are hurting .All in all May God continue extending his grace to this family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maurine,  If I were you  I could just park and go believing God to bless me with my own husband  more than  Justifying  myself everyday that  am not a home  destroyer."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think she lacks confidence too. She must be an Empath, she and Cera. Their husband's probably a narcissist person, he will love himself only, others are still coming, if not he will be playing them with others. They're enabling him in his immaturity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We have a child here, where do you go leaving your child with someone. Better I stay and raise my child, than fight endless battle with the father. I prefer my peace."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Home wrecker for that manner
q4sWUJxjc4g,Question is who does Abraham love
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@ktutorials2139  I can't see any problem when people are compatible and are reasoning for their happiness
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cannot allow such a relationship in my Life waaaaah Serah just move on hapa hakuna Love.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not Judging but I just don't like Maureen deep down she knows that she took someones else Husband and tried to ruin Serah's Household,I second Lynn words.""It will end in premium tears wacha tu ya Jamal tuliona.
To Abraham take this to the bank.Mtaka yote ukosa yote.
I believe this is not easy as they talk wanaficha tu white.#serah Mamah you need help and its not late don't be forced to settle for what you didn't want or wish it was Abraham choice let him deal with it........uyo Maureen hapana she's not what you think trust me."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If you can't fight them, you join them. So sad for cerah."
q4sWUJxjc4g,The wife is hot 🔥
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham ...u r selfish
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham the way you talk passionately about moreen and looking into her eyes with 😍 tells your attention is more on her and less on serah.i feel for serah I shed tears on her behalf 😥😥
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To the Abraham's plz continue lighting the fire,don't listen to haters,haters gonna hate forever I know most of this ladies are only jealousy or they are victims of circumstances that's why most of them are bitter but it is what it is,to Maureen dokagoagoe maitho maa ciura matigegiria ngombe inywee mai as long as u respect the first wife go go gal,kudos to wacera for kushikilia your position."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your story reminds me of mom exactly how she portrayed her marriage when in reality she was miserable   she cried herself the whole week before bringing my dad's mistress home and l never forgave her for it coz it broke our home even more than it was. Few years later the lady moved on like nothing ever happened  with her kid and remarried. anyways good luck
q4sWUJxjc4g,To be honest that marriage arrangement of abraham will not work in the long run
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's just a matter of time as a woman that's 🤮🤮🤮
q4sWUJxjc4g,This interview Lynn wah! Honestly speaking this is a no for me it's not about being judgemental but clearly Serah as the first wife didn't have a choice.Abraham knew Serah very well as Maureen said...The fact that Maureen feared shows that deep down in her conscience she knew it was wrong...Even if you are a second wife live in your own house
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't believe a man can love two women the same way.  There are 2 stories in the Bible, that plainly show examples of this.  The 1st was Jacob had two wives Leah and Rachel.  The Bible said Rachel was Beautiful, but she couldnt have children.
Leah was not beautiful.
Jacob loved Rachel not Leah.  His uncle tricked him into marrying Leah. God opened Leah's womb because he knew Jacob hated her.  Jacob kept being intimate with her, and giving her babies even though he hated her. Leah thought she had Jacob's love, but she was wrong, he still hated her.  Sex does not equal love. Eventually, Rachel had two sons Benjamin and Joseph. Joseph was the Prime Minister of Egypt.
The 2nd story was about Elkanah who had two wives Peninnah and Hannah.
The Bible says for He loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb. Hannah couldn't have children.
Peninnah had alot of children, and she made fun of Hannah until she cried and refused to eat.  This is in 1 Samuel 1:7.  Elkanah gave Peninnah what she needed for her children, he took care of her but he didn't love her.
Hannah went to the temple to pray, and God gave her a boy named Samuel who was a Prophet.
How can a man love two women at the same time?
Even if he's a player, he will eventually wear himself out.
The heart can only hold so much.  If he loves two women at the same time, he will have to choose who he really loves and stay with her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Most of you feel sorry for Cerah but this woman is very calculative first for her asking Maureen to move in hapo already ashafunga bwana.
2nd yeye anaendelea while Maureen ako tu so yeye pesa inaletwa kwake.
She is a very smart woman when Abraham dies God forbid she gets to keep the house n Poor Maureen will have nothing left so Maureen my advice to you fungua macho usilalie maskio have something for yourself"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When serah said what he loves about Abraham and she said how unlucky she has been since when she was born, this made me shed tears and this also made Abraham feel bad and guilty
I feel that Abraham loves Maureen More than serah and that's why when serah asked about Maureen he told him no matter what he will take Maureen and they have a child.
Serah loves Abraham soo much and she has been afraid of leaving him
Abraham loves Maureen more than he love serah
Abraham spend most of the time with Maureen and he doesn't feel like he is missing the other one
Aki Maisha wewe!
Finally, l love how Abraham is trying to hide that he love both equally

I love Maureen cz he respects serah, l love serah cz she accepted Maureen may be because she feared that Abraham may be taken away kabisa by maureen

I love Abraham cz he is trying hard to balance the love to the two
Meanwhile,
Am waiting for your content huko kwa Abraham's empire

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wah, my husband kama ako na pesa anaweza oa second wife badala ya mzururo here and there, bt bt, ajengewe kwake wee na aishi tumaisha twake😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"wow i love their story,,,,,,,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy amekalia the first wife, he doesn't love her at all...so sad"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Is Maurine ready for the third wife coz huyu Abraham ata watatu ataleta 🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,People judging others for sinning differently.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don’t know I really don’t like this man 🥲 ati I have no intention of kuleta Madharau you already did it you should have said before or while talking to the lady if you are that brave
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Like someone sad, there is nothing to be proud about this story. This is one interview Lynn will ever get to do that has no impact on the viewers in my opinion. This is just a pure case of infidelity and betrayal of the highest order I don't care if your religion allows it or not. A young man like this should be satisfied with one wife unless he doesn't really like the first wife that much. I am sure if the first wife had refused to be in the equation he wouldn't have minded if she decides to live. And she probably just gave in because she thought she had no choice.

All this nonsense about each women being unique in their own way is the same card our Yul Edochie is playing for us here in Naija it doesn't work like that. You are just a man who is married and still have his eyes outside. So every fair skin woman you meet who meets your standard you will take as a wife?... hmmmm 3rd and 4th wife is probably loading...all these long throat men we have everywhere. Just look at him... young, handsome and enterprising but looks very classless with 2 wives, honestly there is nothing classy about polygamy especially in this our time and age.

This guy would have earned more respect if he stock to his first wife. And the so call 2nd wife I wonder what she was thinking getting involved and becoming a second wife. As young as she is is she that desperate? sharing the intimacy that another woman enjoys with her husband. Sarah can never have her husband's full attention. She is only playing along but deep down she is pained but just doesn't have a choice.

They can form love and unity all they want, at the end of the day one of them is still close to his heart than the other no matter how he choose to explain it. Though they all look lovey dovey but lets see what the future holds.

What is my own sef I wish them bliss."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you for this comment.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your comment has touched my soul. Thank you so much. All the advice I was looking I have got it. God bless you. I am in a relationship with a man who has a girlfriend and they have two kids together but they never got married in a family or church. When I met this man I observed his behaviors it seemed  like the girlfriend was the only woman in his heart and this always made me feel like I am cheating on someone. I asked him what he will do when she finds out that he is madly in love with me. He said she will accept since they are not married but I told him that kids are the best vows. We often argued about me being the third part of this relationship. I told him that I can't be the second wife then he said he will leave the girlfriend and marry me. To be honesty I asked him the girlfriend's number so that I will be able to communicate with her until I decide. He gave it to me. He told her that I am a close friend of his but her sense always tells her that we are lovers which is true. I sat with the man and I told him to build a house for her and the kids and at least go to her parents to give a dowry in order to respect her and her parents. Which he accepted and told me that he had the idea long ago. He is hustling daily to fulfill that promise and he has started to build for them. I know he told me that the girlfriend cheated on him twice and his love for her changed but he couldn't break up with her coz he didn't have another girl. I take it as an excuse of leaving her. I reached the time and I wanted to quit this relationship and he insisted but honestly my heart judges me when I think about his daughters and girlfriend. Watching these ladies with their husband and falling on your comment has given me another chance of thinking twice. I know it is not easy when you truly love someone but again Karma is real and it doesn't fail the address. It's hard to understand that this man equally  loves these women like you said one of them is closer to his heart than the other. We are no body to judge but the truth hurts while healing I guess I need to be prepared of getting hurt when I break up with my boyfriend. I sometimes get confused and I feel guilty. Thanks again for your comment.
q4sWUJxjc4g,CORRECT
q4sWUJxjc4g,Mmhmmh you can tell thank you for your honest 💃🌹🌹
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So will he bring another friend to his wives,?.. do they have a choice? Such nonsense!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,What money can do 😱🥲
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I am not good when it comes to writing  comments , but really! This is a real betrayal to the first wife. Let not sugar coat sins"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Immorality or not. Let’s appreciate Abraham for bieng a strong father and accepting Maureen’s baby outside his marriage. How many men do exactly this is secret?
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's his baby
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sera loves Abraham, but it's obvious his heart belongs to Maureen. When Sera got emotional my heart broke and bled for her 💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Did she get emotional
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think the same too, he loves Maureen more!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,May God give Sara the strength 🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"From the story, Abraham met his soulmate in Maureen and not Serah. Abraham knew that Sera will always love him despite the betrayal that's why he didn't waste the chance to bring Maureen and her child into Sera's space, when Sera looks back on how much she will lose if she walks out,she decided to welcome the second family . The empire they have built with Abraham made her stay.
She still loves the husband and she can absorb anything her husband brings.

Maureen knew what she wanted,a soulmate,a business partner and someone to make her dreams come true ( a supportive loving caring husband)"
q4sWUJxjc4g,She said she is happy😅😅😅😅why are you saying she got emotionoooo
q4sWUJxjc4g,women shouldnt stoop this low. I discern desparado by Sarah and an evil by Maureen. i don't know why she even shares a name with me. Evil woman! Manipulative and abusive Abraham. Women shouldn't allow male chauvinism. This guy is just abusive and manipulative. Sarah clearly has low self esteem. That is why she allowed this man to manipulate her and treat him that way. mxm!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Abraham does love moreen he is just lusting after her she loves serah iyo lust ikiisha ndio his mind will start functioning

Or He rushed to marry serah and later he came to find his soulmate in Maureen so serah is just house warming so she need to Walk out and find her soulmate too it's never too late"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham, you are unwise, you are selfish please do to other as you would like to be done unto you. Maureen, you are not genuine from deep inside your heart you know you are not what you say. Sarah i respect you, you are such a wise woman, but don't wait for too long before you exit. You don't have to waste your life with a man that has lost love for you. Abraham no longer loves you is your wisdom that still keeps you into this marriage but till how far? This is nonsensical."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He answers for Sarah .  Sarah looks like someone who has accepted her situation.  The guy is a narcissist and very fake.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The situation is boosting his insecurities.  When Cera leaves he will get himself another wife.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"His family and many wives to come are here because Sera 's Grace..
God!!!!!!!!!!
Bless this woman,all I have felt listening to this story is only sadness for her."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I was never good enough to be your better half if you bring in another woman into our marriage,Period!!!!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weeee jesoo
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am just wondering  if Abraham decides to marry a third wife, will Maureen embrace her the same way Sera embraced her?
From the story it's better to be a second wife than the 1st wife coz unapata life is better na tupesa tuko."
q4sWUJxjc4g,All is not well with sara shes hearting inside .Lets give them tym in future god knows everything
q4sWUJxjc4g,God created Abraham and Eve  not  Eves 🤮🤮🤮🤮😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,The 🤗  I almost 😭🤣🤣🤣much ❤️ Abraham empire
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is some bs! If he was truly genuine, he shouldn't have had a baby then decide to introduce the lady after he was caught, he should have done it upfront even before getting  the kid....the wife had no choice! I'm all for polygamy lakini this is not it... it's giving forced!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,How lovely is Serah i love her calmness although at sometimes you feel broken and betrayed keep strong dear all will be fine...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yaaa she is betrayed...sanaa
q4sWUJxjc4g,All will be well with Cerah be strong dear
q4sWUJxjc4g,We will always hate on the second wife because we know she's much loved. It's a societal way of discouraging second wives.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True.But funny that men try to convince people that they can love two women at the same time. A big lie
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@Abraham, what was there before Christ was not Christianity but Judaism. Christianity came after Christ and was established by Christ. And the establishment of Christ is that one man should be married to one wife 1Cor7:2. In my view, co-parenting would have been better than polygamy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well this guy has clearly shown his taste in women .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is Ujinga mtuuuuupuu
Immorality is a sin 
The guy things he is the giant NOW 🙄🙄🙄
Lust😏😏😏😏😏
The lady cera had no choice 
He is just trying to justfy his dirtness
I don't support NOTHING 🙄🙄🙄🙄"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Let me mind my own business 😁😁
q4sWUJxjc4g,This story does not have the ability to impact lives. This situation is so disgraceful and just feeds this man's fragile ego!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Right! And based on the very little I see of him, he ain't worth it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Truth 100%
q4sWUJxjc4g,"ATI hii ni kupitia Elena, the only person who has a story here is Sarah.....you don't hurt a person you love because I believe it wasn't easy for Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eti the story has no ability to...🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,I couldn't agree further. Oooh am so irritated by this man and his actions. His arrogance is simply disgusting 😏
q4sWUJxjc4g,Every time I watch this story I feel a certain deep pain. Betrayal is beyond words😭😭😭. I also noted Abraham and Maureen are both wearing white shoes. 🤔🤔. Serah wake up. By the fact that serah was expectant she already was too vulnerable. This man Abraham though. Very few women can handle this like serah did.
q4sWUJxjc4g,True.no woman deserve this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Me too,I feel like shaking cerah out of this trance,my heart is breaking for her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Not only shoes, but wearing bold colors too"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I noticed as well but I thought it was just me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Inauma serah anafaa tu slap moja aamke from that dream.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Father Abraham Sarah and Haggai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah is wise believe me. She knows what she is doing, but she is hurt so much."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen will take over this house and father Abraham.  Cera stay woke before it's too late.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who else felt Cera's parting shot?😭😭😭😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Even she  cried, haki Maureen should just leave before karma gets her private parts"
q4sWUJxjc4g,​@@mamagals364 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

q4sWUJxjc4g,@@mamagals364 🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Weh🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,It’s bad being a second wife with or without a child. Let no child put you in bondage you come first. Period
q4sWUJxjc4g,beautiful family indeed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn has a gift in interviewing.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Your right girl
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you🙏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree, She does it good! Lynn 👍"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Provided there is peace and love,and the man can provide,this is beautiful,hata watatu oa,your there married by your husband ,Hana hata mpango but hauna peace 🙄then kuna hawa wako na Amani,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Women shouldn't be doormats this way. this is a man using his male dominance to intimidate and manipulate women. Abraham took advantage of two women to satisfy his selfish and sexual greed, also satisfying his economic needs. he explained they are both entrepreneur-he is just using them. Sarah acted desperate. I really do not dig this. this abuse of two women. Sarah was co-hersed. mxm! This is just bullshit!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No meet ups,no communication, no bonding for me......uuh uuuuh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Mr Abraham stop sugar quoting your marriage cerah is deeply hurt inside, she had to accept because you told her that you love moureen very much and that she is not going anywhere. She is psychologically tortured."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is lovely too. Humble lady
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cerah had two choices here to choose  her dignity and go or to choose her Family, .......she choose the wrong thing, SAD I would put my mental health first, their story might sound okey but nothing about this is Okey with cerah. But overall Maureen  also have a good heart, am not hating."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pray to God that witch craft never enters your family otherwise Abraham will regret the rest of his life
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Guy doesn't love cerah, the way he speaks that's so narcissistic"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"1. You slept on the carpet because you did not want to choose which room one to go to not because you were confused.
2. Cera finds it easier to have a co-wife. Imagine you never have to worry about your kids when are away coz you trust your 'friend'.
3. Fatherhood should represent a love of God for each person. Polygamy brings comparison which makes this concept hard to understand.
4.Maureen has to always be nice by Cera's standards because she feels she is the offender.
5.Abraham had Cera brought a second man to the marriage would you be reading from the same script?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,On point ..
q4sWUJxjc4g,This interview is just giving Serah the closure she perhaps never had before. Respect to this woman🤔. It’s hard bieng the first woman😔
q4sWUJxjc4g,But why did he not have a different house for his second wife? My heart goes to the first wife...may God see her through
q4sWUJxjc4g,This to me is a symbiotic relationship.. Maureen has so much to bring to the family table.(Finances)
q4sWUJxjc4g,"You are all so beautiful, business smart and so intelligent. Hapo Abraham amejichagulia jiko vizuri sana. I wish you all the happiness  and prosperity in your polygamous family."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is hurting inside let not lie here, we are all human.  How do you move into another woman's home. its hurting."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn umesema tusi judge but no; hamna mapenzi hapo kwa husband to Sarah! my dear Sarah, jiongeze uwe na maisha yako kipenzi! you can't live in bondage of pain in the name of marriage or ""co-wifing"". hapo anayepata raha na amani ni Abraham and the second wife. i'm sorry i judged"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truly I couldn't watch when the 2nd woman started talking, willingly or unwillingly she has capitalized on the weaknesses of Abraham's and Cerahs marriage. So sad that pure hearted people(cerah) will go through hell in the name of tolerance. This is a deep spiritual program crafted to spread adultery in our society in the name of 'love'. That lady capitalized on the weaknesses of that couple, she broke the marriage spiritually and she knows that too. Most marriages stabilize after 10 years or thereabout... Very unfortunate"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is romantic 🌹🌹🌹
q4sWUJxjc4g,For me my dearest ls Sara...May the good lord help her
q4sWUJxjc4g,I can just see Abraham by that time had much love for Moreen an maybe upto today.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah i feel for you😭😭😭 I'm sure there's a third one somewhere and the chain will continue
q4sWUJxjc4g,As Abraham has said...those are two families....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let's not lie to ourselves the jealous in me I can't!! I rather be single the anger wooi for heaven's sake love itself has territorial boundaries even in animal kingdom woiii ,no way thanks ,this thing made me never to have those 'boyfriends girlfriend ' relationships through out my schooling what of a husband jeeezy"
q4sWUJxjc4g,THERE IS NOTHING good  IN THIS STORY SERAH IS NOT HAPPY GOD BE WITH YOU GIRL
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Before you throw stones just look at your life first
I love Abraham's family they are happy keep pushing ❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,We are not stone throwing. We have opinions 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,God told Abraham to leave Hagar and her child. Abraham chased Hagar and her child away. Read your bible well.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I wonder why some people are negative about this family, we should remember the prophets had more than one wife, if it is wrong to marry two or more wives, i think God would have stopped the prophets who God used to speak to."
q4sWUJxjc4g,This man is just a selfish man periodit and the fact that he is monied ofcourse he can control women God created one man one woman polygamy alter has been raised already
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I liked the way you asked Abraham when he was explaining himself how he started telling sera about Moreen 😭in a small voice that how about love
q4sWUJxjc4g,🥺😳😳😳😳😳
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is not like haaappy there is no love  here he would have built kila MTU kwake
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is madness 😂😂😂 zero judgement
q4sWUJxjc4g,hahahaha walai
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Let me just ask, since Sera also lacked attention from father Abraham, would Abraham have been ok with her sleeping with some else???? Would he accept the betrayal? Ata iwe chini ya maji tu, unlike his public show...... Personally if what Serah is going through is strength, then let me remain weak. Its said men cheat, but don't do it to my face worse still don't bring her to my house!!!! Mimi staki kwenda Lang'ata..... Moral of the lesson that opposite gender you keep hearing of chunga sana. But from how Ceera talks, she loves Abraham too much and I pray her heart is at peace"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cerah loves  abraham sana sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,But hawa beautiful women wanakaa twins
q4sWUJxjc4g,If Sera is okey then who are we to worry..all the best The Abraham's
q4sWUJxjc4g,I would say this in Kikuyu Abraham ena ugi wa mabuku na wa muciarire those are two different things that's why he can manage two ladies 🤗
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Under one roof is where I draw the line, whether I'm the 1st or 4th wife,let's have some standards guys, I'm not ready to spend nights with my supposed husband in the same house while he sleeps next room with another woman."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't want to imagine...
q4sWUJxjc4g,I feel so bad for the first wife. Her needs are not met and she’s so so beautiful 😍
q4sWUJxjc4g,Moreens heart is Soo black 🖤 may no other woman bare the pain of serah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very black.
q4sWUJxjc4g,maureen is a evil person very evil not only black but a dark heart. she is a husband snatcher
q4sWUJxjc4g,And a home wrecker too 😞 She will forever be guilty of what she did to Cerah
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I don't support polygamy at all 😐
q4sWUJxjc4g,truth be told Cerah is not comfortable but hana otherwise. My advice Cerah and Maurine should live in different places.
q4sWUJxjc4g,so sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes it’s working because Sera didn’t want to lose her husband,Maureen fell into a trap of Abraham’s greed, could have been different if she wanted it that way by walking away,Maureen is a beautiful & intelligent woman)these are results of adultery & infidelity at it’s best,no other way to go about it,Maureen tangled herself in this by choosing not to walk away, am sure she would easily meet a better husband,the world is full of beautiful women, listen at him mentioning light skinned, how poor’ the kind of men he is won’t end at having 2 wives, they legitimise their infidelity by marrying more wives,Sera could see it coming &succumbed in this arrangement to keep her family intact, it’s a shame that Maureen fell into this because she appears intelligent, hardworking & beautiful like Sera, this man used tactics that men that enjoy adultery use,no woman wants their child to suffer but Maureen you have yourself to blame for engaging yourself in this entanglement,you deserve better?& you know it , you need your own husband not somebody else’s husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,My great grandfather had 31 wives my grandfather had three wives an my three grandmother they dressed same clothes if u invite one u have to invite both they loved themselves too much  there kids they buy presents to three mums not one I love them soo much 🥰❤️🔥
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's just a different type of sin and doesn't make any other person holier...only God should be the judge. I come from a polygamous family and we live peacefully with my step brothers and sister even after dad and stepmom left (may they rest in eternal peace)
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Woi. I wish y'all had just continued to stay in your little private cocoon. The more you are out here trying to convince us y'all are happy or whatever else your motive is, you've now opened the door fully to satan and he doesn't leave until he has accomplished his mission to either kill, steal or destroy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is in pain still😭😭
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah you are a strong lady for me I can't 😲😲😲😲😲. No man will stand a lady with two guys why us.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen looks older
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yeah
q4sWUJxjc4g,That part of Moreen being moody in the morning before Lynn comes has made me laugh loudly you people are funny 😅😅so you get angry at times i didn't see it coming 🤣😂 🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen cheka kabisa but remember you have a daughter   eti how is Cerah and you want people to believe that 🙄.. Cerah be strong I can feel your  disappointments and pain but there is God in heaven as for father Abraham just because a woman is calm and understanding doesn't mean you hurt her feelings continue playing superior time will tell ... nothing to smile about here
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, tupelekwe pole pole 🤣🤣🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Talk about Serah’s, Maureen’s & Lynn’s earrings"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn Serah will never be happy fully but survive with a fake smile. All in all I wish them all the very best👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Why do people keep saying Sarah had no option ?Women have options.If your husband is abusive or decides to take on another woman and you don't feel right move on. You can see the pain in her eyes when she says he distanced himself, he would make excuses and say it's raining. The way the man and second wife laughed like as if Sarah was joking. It's really painful for a husband to lie about his were abouts yet his busy somewhere Vibing another woman.
I can see a man sitting down with his wife and saying what do you think of polygamy, would you like to be a sister wife? Those conversations should be had at the start of the relationship. But this second relationship came on as a result of cheating on Sarah so this is completely wrong. Sarah should have walked out and left him with his new wife. Women we need to empower ourself and have our own money to be able to provide for our selves."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Empowerment is the key to avert such kind of disrespect.  She may have feared being out in the cold and not sure how to start life alone.
q4sWUJxjc4g,It takes  boldness to have 2wives living in the same house.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If my heart had a soul mate I would watch this trembling, shaking and worried but because God is my lover I had to watch it comfortably...#wueeh#"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Iam trembling my dear, suspicious all the way from today.you just spoke my mind."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wueeeh 😆 my heart ♥️ is fragile siwes mek
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hii mambo ya mapenzi wewe🤣🤣mmmh sitaki.
q4sWUJxjc4g,One of the most stressed men are polygamous men. They don’t know peace. This looks like a situationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,They die early due to stress. It’s not easy keeping two women and their children satisfied and in line.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is crazy.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ceera is so beautiful n  very wise
q4sWUJxjc4g,People should stop judging this family the only difference they have with other families is that they are living together.men out here are married but they have mpango wa Kando with kids..how many men sleep out and they are married..how many married  women know their husbands are cheating but there is nothing they can do..personally I would never live with a co wife but let's accept reality this things are happening out here ..serah has her own reasons as to why she accepted Maureen to her home but I think the best thing is for them to live separately one person must be suffering in silence..it's not easy
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me am just burning inside my heart😭😭is feel sorry for sera.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah looks sad. Chances are that she’s not financially empowered and she doesn’t have enough self love. 

The second wife …..well well well…..what can I say? Same as Sarah. Lack of self love and financial muscle. 

The man? Father Abraham 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Burukenge tu! Take another one. It’s just a matter of time. His face looks so so slappable. If this was my son, Kîrûhí twaaaaaaaa! 

At least get the two ladies different houses. 

Mothers: please empower your daughters. Teach them marriage isn’t an achievement. Teach them what self love is. Teach them to be financially independent so they can afford to leave when respect and love isn’t being served anymore. 

Mothers: Teach your sons women are not toys. Fragile masculinity is what your seeing here. Fragile ego being stroked by two women with no self esteem and money. 

I’ve tried my best to be polite here.
When an African man calls you wife material - think of these two women. Sad!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Veeery true
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂its the slappable for me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very right
q4sWUJxjc4g,Correct
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True he should settle them each her own home,serah akue free"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"People like to quote people on scripture to justify having many wives but just look at how their children ended up being. Example someone like David one of his sons raped his own sister, one other son swore to kill him. 

This man met his second wife through Infidelity. And maybe one day the pain Serah felt when the other wife entered her marriage, no.2 will experience it too. Infidelity (polygamy)always breeds pain.  Always!!! There's no escape no matter how we sugarcoat and glorify it."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn my dia...u are amazing woman.... Mrembo I love your interviewing skills.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Forgive me but won't watch this. Sarah is paining inside.n I won't glorify this.na ukweli Sarah is much beautiful..
q4sWUJxjc4g,let me not read the comments so i watch this story objectively😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Just one question to Serah & Moureen. If Mr. Abraham falls down dead today, will you continue living together as the "" best of friends"" that you claim to be? Kuuliza tu"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I always feel ni kama siku moja huyo Maureen ataja kutoka kwa Sarah kama Haggai😢😢aiii no no right
q4sWUJxjc4g,I haven't watched yet but the comments though!.....Polygamy has in most cases doesn't end well and no woman desires to be in one...ni kuvumilia tu.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No words

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Much love and respect to Cerah.I'm sure  if  Maureen was the first wife,she wouldn't accept a co wife.Do not do to others what you wouldnt like be done to you.I hope she finds her husband coz not matter how you try to beautify it,it will never be Kweli wanaume ni wachache"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aki keyboard worriers about de Mathews thy talked, wanjohis, muigais,, this guys love each other and no matter what we write and say nothing can separate them.... Thy are comfortable"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I still feel Maureen should be in her house ......there is no joy in sharing a man
q4sWUJxjc4g,Cera had no choice. U can see pain through her eyes.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Skia ATI all along she had the number ndio Abraham akiturn his back on her agecall Sarah, Sarah may God bless you for accepting this homeless Maureen"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"I have had of this story but never watched it but now am here 🤗,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serahs pain is soo visible she is trying soo much to hide it bt she just cant i just wish she walked away no woman deserves this kind of life n disrespect🥶
However much we might glorify this marriage,Gods word is the same today yesterday n forever God hates polygamy n that why the only basis for divorce is adultery. The bible is very clear any woman who sleeps with a man who is not their husband commits adultery and Maureen is doing it everyday in this situation. More power to serah i hope she will one day be able to do right by her🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very blessed and luckiest man on this planet

Letting people control you this much in terms of business is not good. She has the more children and therefore she just fled with what she is told. She has to be involved in the business as well and not just a homemaker. I have nothing against Maureen. They are all beautiful ladies. I just believe you cannot love two people equally. I pray this marriages last. If only people seemed the lord and honored him then our morals and values would be different. I do not advocate for polygamy . However, if it makes the two ladies and the man happy then I wish them all the best. They should involve the lord in their lives and all will be well ."

q4sWUJxjc4g,😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,I agree Maureen to be served her own tea
q4sWUJxjc4g,I don't like ceras softness i think men tend to take advantage of such. But God knows what her plan is
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham loves Maureen truly. The one he truly connects with. Cerah was just a good cleaner. Quiet and easy to walk over. I hope she finds herself and moves out of this toxic relationship.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well put
q4sWUJxjc4g,i concur
q4sWUJxjc4g,I also hope this love btwn Maureen  and Abraham is what we will see even after 20yrs and not faking
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am in this ....well put
q4sWUJxjc4g,Wooishe ipity this beautiful soul
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If they are happy, it is okay. They are doing life the way they need to, it serves them. I love how adorable they are. I wish them well and thank you for sharing your story. If people come for you with negativity, that is projection, keep living in harmony."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great advice
q4sWUJxjc4g,Great insights..exactly my sentiments
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True.. it's projection. This story exposes people's insecurities and fears, which they then project to this couple"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@alicenalulwe84  I second.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Actually serah loved Abraham when he had nothing    she is a wife material 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"ile ujinga iko Kenya, Weeeh. Even our ancestors knew best than keep two wives under same roof. This man will not live long."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not here to judge but you can tell that Serah is hurting no normal lady wants to share their husband for Maureen,she is not be a destroyer however She could have looked for another man and left a married man to the wife and this story should stop circulating we are only selling a sin"
q4sWUJxjc4g,He really has a type. Love is a beautiful thing is all I can say
q4sWUJxjc4g,👀👀👀
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Father Abraham had many wives, many wives had father Abraham,  l am one of them and so are you so let's just praise the Lord, if you know that song... I reserve my comments because it's only them who know the truth🤔. lynne asked a very good question, Can you love 2 at the same time?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is a lie, which woman is happy to see his man with a another woman, women are jealous in nature not unless those women are also lovers"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Am not convinced!
Lyn ur questions are on point , well done"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is ok that this is working out for this couple/s but let others not think this is ok. It can cause grief. These  people have their issues some of which they cannot admit in public. It just goes to show that men should not marry young. Abraham married before he really knew what kind of wife he wanted. He was double dealing the two ladies but Cera's wisdom is what has brought them to this place. 
I still think these ladies should not be under same roof each queen needs her domain. This will eventually get complicated."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Textbook predator look at these sweet natured women that’s not a coincidence. It’s about business this business that. All wazee now talking about tradition were not even born when our forefathers renounced this old religion but our Kikuyu community is busy reviving old spirits. May God forgive us because these three are also his beloved children. This is not the first of this I’m seeing. Not even back then did the two women share a house jamani hii ni mambo gani ya kipepo that has trapped our generation. He will marry a fourth fifth etc. These women need therapy this one with his sly tongue has quashed their thinking and confidence. Anyway were these things not written that seven shall take a man and say marry us?  I become so angry because no one thinks of the psychological impact on the children born of this… The devil has gotten our men in the name of traditions that were long buried for a reason.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is not bibilical .no matter how much you will pamper it.its wrong and illegal..lts traditional.this is not the will of God who created you.we are in trouble in our marriage .
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is what happened to my mum years back..she did the same but what happens years later!!!serah honestly you are making a wrong move,you might see this as if it's right but truth be told very wrong mamaaa.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Do you think one person (I guess erotic love) can love two people at the same time? I think unless you aren't human, it happens all the time. Those against this for moral reasons should be first to judge themselves. Plus remember, these are adults all consented to be in the relationship and they are married"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If I was serah I would have married another business man too with more money 😂😂 since we are 'looking beyond love'.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Now you are talking 😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ooooh yes ndio tukue equal kwani iko nini 😂😂

I really  like the way you ask  the questions. 
For cera, hugs mummy,you have a big heart ❤ and it's  a blessing 💖"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This guy is lucky to have two beautiful women with beautiful hearts..Wow love both women.. Thanks to the second wife for respecting the first one.The first wife is one wise woman..The world needs such people.Thank you for making this world a better place.Watching from Eswatini.. sometimes we can't hear Swahili, tried to press cc button but there weren't options for subtitles m"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I love polygamy marriege, but with my own house, own space😊. Seem like people have adopted Western life. Yey we have polygamy in Africa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The second position in marriage is never for a virtuous woman.  A woman of self respect wont dare to entre another woman's life. No matter how hard you try sugar coat it, in one way or another your kids will feel lost. You'll model a bad character to your daughters and bring confusion to your sons. The moment Maureen realized Abraham was married she should drawn the line there and then, by diluting her feelings towards him and blocking him from her life. She shouldn't have waited to the extent of having a baby with him knowing he's a family man. Despite the fact that Abraham compelled Maureen to be with him, it was her place to show him and make it clear to him that you don't always get what you want. I believe a virtuous woman will always want to live a life they can defend before God, which is not Maureen's case. I feel like Maureen and Abraham took advantage of Serah's calmness and selflessness. I mean Serah is a full package and that's what any man would kill to have."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True he even mentioned it earlier, that sarah is calm"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Highly well said 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I think if become too calm a man will think you are okay with polygamy, it good to be tough and harsh so that he knows that it's not allowed ata akimoa atampeleka mbali"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Well said.
q4sWUJxjc4g,​@queen_pila you said it ❤
q4sWUJxjc4g,How Lynn takes the Interview is Great.....🥰🥰u are just Super amazing
q4sWUJxjc4g,100%
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hopefully this lasts forever it's doable because our parents lived it.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something is not clear here....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's ok to have 2wives but atleast mtu akuwe na kwake private , like huku saudi men have 4or 2wives but different houses  and only on Friday you find all wives together kwa wife mkubwa wakikula lunch all together na watoto. It's all depends na voice ya mzee."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i doubt serah is happy, she had no choice really...women please lets work hard, money gives u some dignity"
q4sWUJxjc4g,But she is rich too.With resources
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@nyamburaadventures_ke if she is maybe its the man who has supported her and she is a time bomb waiting to explode
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This pure nonsense, bottom line is SERAH WAS BETRAYED ,in my opinion she has stayed for the sake of her kids ."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Women need to be empowered so they don't entertain such crap. Sarah looks very miserable 😔.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She looks sad n depressed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truth is,nobody can love anyone equally but God alone.. Even parents tend to have their favourite child among the kids they have....Only God knows what is in this family's hearts....Sad story though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,The best interview ever in regards to this arrangement
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I don't understand why people keep saying sera is not happy, everyone has a personality unless you stay with her and understand her personality. Polygamy is there in Africa and nothing can stop it. Muslims do it and it's all okay but with Christians seems like a big deal here. Yet we see how this Christians pastors and all have kids outside marriage.  Married Gikuyu women relax y'all. 😂😂😂"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When you look at serah she's not happy, leave mama"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Leave and go where? U invest na mwanaume alafu umuache?
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@maggiemuiruri6948 as long as ako uhai atatafta tena, so what ju ame invest time na mwanaume haoni worth yake? Is he the only man??? Peace and happiness is more important"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I personally see lots of love ❤ but would be better if he bring a smaller  😉 girl 👧 than moreen Sasa hawa watafika menopause pamoja 😄 🤣 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There is nothing to glorify here, it's clear the first wife is not happy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Absolutely nothing
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am happy to see Abraham
q4sWUJxjc4g,I love 💕 this it's so adorable I think he did well to tell Serah about Maureen instead of hiding it from her ...they all look happy and comfortable with each other 💯The Abrahams I love them
q4sWUJxjc4g,He never did.... If u listen well it's Serah and Maureen who discovered by themselves. He was cheating on Sera with Maureen
q4sWUJxjc4g,Hmmmm
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@puritymukami6657 @@@
q4sWUJxjc4g,Another story of a 'strong African woman' who was cheated on by the husband. He had an affair and even went ahead and got a kid and the first wife just stayed. Went ahead and even let her into the house to live with them. Interesting!
q4sWUJxjc4g,it's sad to see
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very interesting
q4sWUJxjc4g,A classic story we have heard too many times.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sadly.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wuiiiii serah u r soo beautiful , i know it was not easy."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Waaaaa mimi siwezi kaaa na competitor. I love Cera, she is so sweet. This maureeen is not even beautiful, she looks sly, hapa alichora tu apate bwana...Trapped with the baby."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Co-wife; Same house??? Really ata kama...Sad and hard to watch.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Hii inakaa ngumu,but anyway......... wishing you all the best .The two ladies got a lot in common and they seem to be getting along with each other sooo well."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why are we gloryfying sin🙆🙆
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen is still so guilty....you can tell...it is written on her face and voice....Karma awaits you Maureen...trust me
q4sWUJxjc4g,@alice peter 😂

q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera very beautiful ❤️😍 the tears sera cried over u moureen you will pay
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If this is real Sara is not happy ad this guy doesn't love them equal,I feel he loves Maureen more n sioni ka wataenda far kitalipuka one day"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's never easy to be in such relationship bt it's better kivyangu kuliko kuhanywa coz it's really normal for men to cheat as long as you treat them well bila mapendeleo  ni sawa bt hii haitaki roho ndogo weeeuh

q4sWUJxjc4g,I felt pain on behalf of Sera throughout the interview
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same here
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@janetlangat-m3c This is real pain. She didn't have an option. She is still hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same here😔

q4sWUJxjc4g,Very impressive until two ladies will kulana
q4sWUJxjc4g,How long will this journey last ...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wife no two,looks like a killer, sorry so say tht"
q4sWUJxjc4g,En be careful  Sarah's goodness don't play around with it
q4sWUJxjc4g,They say polyamy is being African but also no African proverb goes to waste two wives in one house is a pot of poison...

q4sWUJxjc4g,I can detect pain in serah's eyes as she tries to explain how she started noticing changes in her husband..
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the truth that people don't want to hear
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So iburahimu you lacked value in Sarah ,you need a hot slap"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yes .you can love more than one person..
People require different attention . different love, different way of living..yes..it can always work..I know it can..it's happiness at the end of the day"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"i will definitely get two husbands. does it mean sera akiget another man,she should love him?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sasa mnasema she ain't happy, na wengine wenu ni side chicken, Mundu ni niaige gwake uria Ekweda"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"We can normalize sin, sugarcoat it but it still remains sin. No woman has ever been comfortable with another woman in her life."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"En I feel Sarah is still.figuring it out ,,, she is still fearing to leave her kids in a single parent hood"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I could never do it. Never
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ladies ladies come let us reason  together  do you think the first wife   ni mjinga vile amejicompose me am thinking she is cooking something and very soon she will walk out of that marriage and share what she went through in that marriage that's my thought as a woman.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham likes yello yello. He will definitely get another one with more yello on her.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham..is okey confessing that at times it hard handling the two
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, lemme tell you, I had a strong urge to request you for this story on your channel but I didn't know how. Thanks. They had an interview on ntv which was short and at metha ya kagoni which was Kikuyu. Next look for 'the Wanjohis', let's hear their side of the story"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn is a very intelligent and tough Queen, i just love her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The way sin is being glorified nowadays,it's shocking!!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Don't you exalt sin yourself.. talking as if you are innocent

q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maureen changing the story ?????? comparing to the other interviews
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn, kindly invite Pastor T to the show to discuss the same topic.Personally I think this will encourage men to bring in their side chicks into their marriages hence destroying marriage institution kabisa."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Moreen just move out of others family let's stop sugar coating whole this ,,,,,lest Sarah move out en create your own empire leave nonsense you can't live in this pain"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""They're both mine""....that was bold."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Maskini serah it’s clear she’s not okay. Baba Abraham love Maureen more. Weeeuh!! Hii apana.
q4sWUJxjc4g,serah is getting emotional and i wanna give her a hug.....Maureen looks like a great lady too. Polygamy is very painful but if they have found happiness within their marriage then may they protect that even when people are very negative.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"She is hiding alot in her heart, she is forcing smile"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The 1st mistake they have done is to come to social media. 
If Sarah is truthful, I wish them well!🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Maureen deserves better too, she doesn't need to live defending herself for the rest of her life.. Hope she wakes up too."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@winniegacheri6889 Maureen got herself into this situation. She dated a married man, slept with a married man, got impregnated by a married man, had a baby with a married man, moved in with a married man. And now she is living in the house of a married man and his wife. Her self esteem must be very low."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham is a fine wine 🍷 🤣🤣 I know some women are planning to be the third wife 🤣🤣🤣

q4sWUJxjc4g,Was wondering where i can get his number 😢😂😂😜😜😜
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Come to think about it, the guy is man enough not to keep secret wife/wives and put it in the open. We have seen guys having multiple partners and kids with different women out there and painting a picture of one wife. I don't support it but he's one courageous man."
q4sWUJxjc4g,He has the guts because he knows serah is soft and I feel like he didn't care if she said anaenda. Most men hide because they are afraid of losing the first family.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sooon he will bring  a 3rd one this man  cannot be trusted smchew!!!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Put your enemies closer
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is burning from inside, don't lie my sister"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Men,,men,God be with sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It makes me think that if this how the arrangements always end, I'd rather be a second wife. There's no joy in being a first wife, work, persevere, tolerance and also enable a man to meet the love of their life (soon after life becomes merrier). There's no joy in silently dying in pain of betrayal. There's no need of dying while alive(when you stop living for you and live for the sake of children).   We are living in a society full of hypocrisy. We are raising children full of bitterness. We are so selfish not to care if people around us are hurt by our actions. I pray that women work hard to avoid exchanging their self respect with basic needs. Oh,,,and woman, give birth because you want to. Not because you want to give a man a family. Because those children might one day be the reason you tolerate abuse"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You said it all 👏👏👏👏👏
q4sWUJxjc4g,For real. And not live in the same house. Normally where i come from each wife should have her house
q4sWUJxjc4g,Volume please. This is bitter but true talk
q4sWUJxjc4g,I totally agree with you 💯
q4sWUJxjc4g,Perfectly said.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Which pure intentions
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@alicewaruhiu111 not all second wives have evil hearts some are very intentional and if you watch their channel you'll definitely understand.... Maureen is humble na anarespect Serah sana
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It's how the society is.
Society will always blame a woman.
Coz for my take, Abraham knew he had a wife and he went on to give Maureen dates to a point of getting her pregnant.
So Maureen should accept that society will always blame her."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Is this the only sin that makes the wrath of God to come.people are sinning different types of sin.like me and others.If God says one man and one wife then for every wife there should be a man but according to numbers women outnumber men.

Everybody needs privacy and independence.
And the fact that Maureen has stayed only 1yr,I can confidently say that the 'muikaranio' won't go far"
q4sWUJxjc4g,true staying together is where I draw the line
q4sWUJxjc4g,The fact that there live in the same house makes this story so wierd

Women can't have multiple partners but men are allowed to have as many as they want including concubines. Staying alone is an option most people overlook."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"In my culture you have to ask the First Wife about taking a Second Wife and so forth...sometimes the First Wife is okay because she needs help with all the household stuff e.g. taking care of the home, husband and Agricultural stuff.

q4sWUJxjc4g,Absolutely nothing inspiring about this story coz I feel for the first wife
q4sWUJxjc4g,The Bible says you should honor the marriage bed and keep it Holy  and pure but in this we don't know who is the wife because I don't know how to put it but it's dangerous because the same eyes he used to see and lust at another woman and he had a wife at home he can still use the same eyes to lust at another woman. This is sin its immorality and GOD hates immorality.

Be that Abraham 😊hold on your Queens like Muigai wa Njoroge or even the late Demathew who left the limelight for more than one wife🤗"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"In God's Kingdom, the end will never justify the means.

God will never bless sin, because it is the very thing that separates us from him. And because God's divine gifts magnify His goodness, true and rightful blessings cannot be rooted in sin.

Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.


James 1:17 ESV

So let's be real:
• It's NOT a blessing if you had to hurt others to get it.

• It's NOT a blessing if you had to lie, steal or cheat to get it.

• It's NOT a blessing if you wrecked someone's home to get your boo.

• It's NOT a blessing if you tricked, coerced, manipulated or exploited another to get it.



Ultimately, we will reap what we sow for the wages of sin is death.

Shout out to all those who've seemingly ""lost"" because of doing things the right and honest way, especially in today's world which often makes it seem like trickery, lying, stealing and stepping on others is the only way to get ahead.
You haven't lost. The Lord doesn't sleep or slumber. He will honor your faithfulness.

And to those who haven't been, the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. There is grace at the foot of the cross for us all 🤎"

To the second wife woow am amused by you, keep respecting the first wife. Atleast Leo nimeona Abraham. Metha ya kagoni covered the story in KiKuyu."

q4sWUJxjc4g,"It is not a blessing if you had to ruin someone's home to get a husband. God doesn't confuse Himself and His word is the only thing that will stand even when this world ends. We dont think you meddled in someone's marriage, we KNOW. Maureen also knows this. Let us be truthful and honest. We will not meddle in your life unless you bring it to our screens but let the truth stand. One way the devil does is bring something even though it has no issues so in the coming generations women will all be trying to be with one man just to share the name. Actually that is what the Bible prophesied about the end times. The moment polygamy reigns, women suffer and everyone can see the woman who's suffering in this marriage. This is ALMOST LIKE polyamory in the western countries, they dont know that it was birthed in Africa... a relationship of three and people will argue sio the same because the women dont have sex together but I hope u see how the devil has played his game. Two wife relationships brought about polyamory. May God save our generation. THE DEVIL WILL START SOMETHING UP AND EVEN IF THAT PARTICULAR PEOPLE END, THE DEVIL NOW INTRODUCES THE SAME THING IN AN UPGRADED FORM SO YOU DONT SEE IT AS NEW BUT ALL ALONG HE HAD BROUGHT THE FIRST THING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE UPGRADED ONE. This is why some people will not see the issue with two wives."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is my take without apology , sin is sin even  it’s massaged."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Funny in the Bible there was or is polygamy and mistress.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@sibongilesibisi9440 just because it is recorded, doesn't mean it is recommended. Even in the 10 commandments, God condemns adultery. In the Bible, Hosea married a prostitute, does that mean that God is okay with prostitution? There were murderers, does that mean that God is okey with murder? Even God punished a man after His own heart (David) and we see how that sin came down to the incest in his own house with his children. Read the Bible and understand."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@sue_zanna_G Acha long unnecessary messages. Polygamy was allowed in the Bible. It may not be the ideal, but it was ALLOWED. Same as divorce. You can't tell people to remain in abusive marriages coz it was not recommended. Or would you.?"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@sibongilesibisi9440 polygamy has never been God's plan and never will. The plan of God was exactly what he introduced in Aden, one wife and one husband. The rest is from the evil one and has only brought tears and chaos."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Congrats to the Abraham's mine is simple they know their goals
q4sWUJxjc4g,Number three waanze  kujitayarisha? asking for a friends friend
q4sWUJxjc4g,No woman wants a second wife in the picture... but here Its the issue of half bread is better than no bread. She didn't have a choice and knew she was fighting a lost battle. If u can't beat them join them kinda situation. A man who start spending the nights out openly doesn't mind loosing you. Sera has overstayed.
q4sWUJxjc4g,The second wife looks older
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wanawake nao tunaruhusiwa kuolewa na wanaume wa wili ama?? By the way, hakunaga ukewenza wenye amani unless mwanaume awe  na HELA I mean TAJIRI sio pesa za madafu. Anyways good luck kwao 👍😊"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Yahweh can never bless a polygamous marriage, we always fear saying the truth coz we fear being attach by harsh words on social media. Let's follow Yahweh's laws as it's written in His Holly book."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Better polygamy than side chick 🐥🐥
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Cookwithsandra1052 true. Plus people sin anyway. It's not like this Kerubo is perfect
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Cookwithsandra1052 A second wife doesn't mean there can't be a side chick.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Amen and amen. However much we sugarcoat it, IT IS STILL SIN."
q4sWUJxjc4g,KaBaba as they call him..They are just glorifying a cheat.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Why share a man with someone..Have a man all to yourself. Second wife this is the 90s.
q4sWUJxjc4g,theres no love here the first wife was silenced she had no option but to stay.Love is jealousy so theres no way this man can love two women at the same time or these two women cannot love one man at the same time.This is so wrong
q4sWUJxjc4g,Clearly he loves the second one
q4sWUJxjc4g,"when Abraham told Serah he must be with Maureen child,that made Serah sink and so she started doing calculation and she knew if don't agree about the union she would have lost it.secondly she want Maureen    to live within so that nothing much is hidden.maureen also has her own thinking she has only one kid.again she knows Abraham's finances.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Sarah if the children are the one's making you to sacrifice your peace and happiness, please stop it....... People don't get married for children but for their own happiness, kids are just but gift from God and a time will come when they will leave you, have their jobs,homes etc...It's not worth it to continue hanging in there unhappy in the name of kids or whatever is holding you back.....Your face can tell it all.....Truth be told if a guy happens to  bring a second wife in his matrimonio home that means he loves the second more than the first wife that's the truth....I pity Sarah"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Only time will tell
q4sWUJxjc4g,"There we go, Maureen saying she wa hurt when she realized the man he wa dating was having another woman.., then what is she telling the world that serah was okay with her invading her family!!!! Maureen what you did was absolutely wrong, you should have respected yourself and walked away. In this scenario you are described as DEATH in this marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Preach that again
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Well put,haha death that came in a sheep clothes"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You have nailed it.

q4sWUJxjc4g,I tell you Bullcrap. We can all see Cera’s  body language. She’s trying too hard to put a happy face
q4sWUJxjc4g,They dated behind her back soo sad
q4sWUJxjc4g,The audacity!
q4sWUJxjc4g,It true serah is heartbroken
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Cera was married coz she's neat and a good house wife.Maureen came in as a career woman who will be assisting the man make money to sustain the family.
If cera was empowered and had her own money she would have moved out of this.
Anywho am happy for them."
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,She's got her own company for God's sake
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This is poor thinking, shes got so many businesses she definitely got money"

q4sWUJxjc4g,"This Couple (hope that is a right address?) has redefined love. They both introduced themselves as ""The Wife"" to Abraham. "" I see Maureen as my friend"", not a co-wife. God bless them. Way better than the mpangos out there. And the man is so graceful and proud of his family. More love to them!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Pretense is in the heart not smiles 😀
q4sWUJxjc4g,They’re a throuple
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham loves Maureen. it's unfortunate that heart matters are complex. He met his soulmate in Maureen. Listen to how he describes how he met the 2 women. Look at his gaze at maureen, how he talks about her. Serah you have overstayed your stay...Life isnt fair, people we love stop loving us but life has to go on. .pls love yourself more and leave, your soulmate could be waiting on the other side of this nonsensical situation."

What are your views on today's story? Do you support polygamy and do you believe one person can love two people at the same time?
You can check out the Abrahams YouTube channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzs3YK69EtLbLLi9cwUFJLA/featured
To share your story with us, send an email to lynnngugi4@gmail.com for consideration.
Thank you so much for watching:)
See you on our next video"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Jesus said husband should have one wife.. You're promoting evil,calling evil good."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Noooooooooo to this. It’s not valid
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No u cant love 2ppl at the same time,he is lying to one..naona sarah ndiye anadanganywa.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I cannot support polygamy ata kama nowadays it's the oder of the day
q4sWUJxjc4g,All I can think of is how the Sister Wives in the US are now. Two have divorced him...he stopped loving two of them. A big mess.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Whara this?
q4sWUJxjc4g,Coming from a polygamous family could NEVER be me 🙀!Anyway to each their own 🤷
q4sWUJxjc4g,"pliz abraham ,everything is about money here,stop lying to us,and leave us alone."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Kikuyu na Vituko are you animals ?????
q4sWUJxjc4g,"""A husband should have one wife"",Jesus said.calling evil good and good evil.i didn't expect this from Lyn I thought shes a true Christian but I understand she's after views."
q4sWUJxjc4g,I said the same when kagoni brought on the wanjohi queens.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Lynn is just doing her job,,,, whether she cover such story or not won't change a thing,,,it's happening n she's here to bring both the good n bad,,,,no need to judge her"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn I like the way you ask question umegrill Abraham kweli kweli wewe na monicah kagoni nko shwari kabiisa.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"makubwa haya,love is a mystery"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"No woman wants her  husband to marry another on her! Which shows he's not satisfied with her, no matter how much he pretends not! If the first lady was given  a secret room she would cry her heart out! But bei g the wise woman she is , she creates a  peaceful environment for herself to service in. But deep inside she's hurting and men got no feelings!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Between sera na Maureen one of them will share one day what they went through in that marriage  mmoja wao akitoka.
q4sWUJxjc4g,No one want to share their husbands and I have some Muslims friends who also feels the same yet their faith allows even four wives.I can bet for a fact that Cera is not happy and I respect her choices to play cool because many of us can not but I hope five years from today they will be together.In Kikuyu we say atumia eri ni nyungu igiri cia urogi.And if Maureen is real let Ibrahim marry another wife and if she will accept her the way she purports to be accepted by Cera then we will be definitely wrong in judging he.But anyway all the best may they change people's perspective of polygamous union by making sure that their union works.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I agree,it is hurting"
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@juliawagatua2346 am a Muslim i myself but i can't withstand this shit even a minute siwezi.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Lynn you are good at what you do .
q4sWUJxjc4g,Something am not getting ...eish my jealousy can't allow me ....
q4sWUJxjc4g,Good luck ladies in marriage. They remind me of sister wives show.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Yes aki 😂😂😂😂 and just as dysfunctional
q4sWUJxjc4g,How will this stop us from our Tingiza mti anthem 😂 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😂you are crazy!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Can't even listen to this cz I don't support
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I hate that these types of stories are coming out so frequently, after the wanjohi queens I vehemently refuse to watch them. 
Our generation is trying so hard to bring back generational curses that plagued our grandmothers because somehow having half a man is better than being single. 
As a Christian I understand Gods perfect law was for one man one woman but his permissive law allowed the greats to be polygamous. 
Jesus was so disgusted by infidelity that he put it as a reason for divorce.
The last book of the Old Testament God is really angry with men who look to replace the women of their youth with younger women, that was his last message. 
I love you lynn but this pure poison ( to me) and will start conditioning women to be ok with it so I will NOT watch any such content."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am also disturbed
q4sWUJxjc4g,@Rosebelle do you think all men abide to that law of one man one  woman.ni vyenye tu hawaoi wawili but obviously kuna kampango ya kado.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@rozinashow5670 whether men obey God or not, it has never changed that God demands them to obey for them to proclaim Him."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Suzzie. profound! ongeza volume
q4sWUJxjc4g,I have no words😌🙌
q4sWUJxjc4g,Such things always have a bad effect on the children no matter what. They get psychologically injured at an early age and grow up with it. Only God can heal them
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is true. The children will pay for the poor decisions made by these three adults. No one seems to think about the children. It’s all about satifying the needs of grown ups especially the man.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Akule matunda ya matendo yake.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I honestly don't like this personally.My view though
q4sWUJxjc4g,"When Lynn asked ""Do you think one person can love two people at the same time?"" Tjoh that hits hard"
q4sWUJxjc4g,😆😆😆😆Lynn and monicah kagoni are the best Lynn anauliza swali direct yenye najiuliza Kwa roho 🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,And did you notice alihepa swali... He answered without answering!
q4sWUJxjc4g,He said he gage  the love by the value of each woman with what each stand for.
q4sWUJxjc4g,"So when Abraham married Sarah it took long before Sarah conceiving a child, which led to Sarah handing her maiden Hagar to Abraham so that she could bore him a child who would inherit Abraham's wealth later, but Hagar started demeaning degrading hurling insult on Sarah that led Abraham to send her away. But in later days Sarah died and Abraham get married to a third wife who was known as Ketura. Abraham tie your waist tight we are still waiting for Ketura"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Very true ketura hanakuja very soon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"#TimelesBeauty, ketura was NOT Abraham's 3rd wife, but second wife after Sarah's death .Haggai was not Abraham's wife but a housemaid and you will find somewhere where God calls Haghai Abraham's wife but lather a ""housemaid""."
q4sWUJxjc4g,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
q4sWUJxjc4g,😂😂😂. Wicked!
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@rosemutinda3076 remember as a grown up and a woman, someone who sees your naked body and have intimacy with is your hubby. So if they had an intimacy which led to Esmael, then Haggar is recorded in Abraham's family as his wife."
q4sWUJxjc4g,i cant comprehend such betrayal is betrayal yes i will forgive but weeuuhh i cant leave na another woman in the same house thats just my two cents anyways good luck to them maisha haitaki makasiriko but weeeuuhh
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eish and the wives eloquence weuuh💯💯💯❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,I follow sister wives on TLC kumbe iko kenya.....wueh!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Me too.they remind me of them
q4sWUJxjc4g,"This man should stop lying to himself you cannot love two people at the same time  ,God hakusema two wives he said one man one wife men stop going against  God's will period.naona very soon Abraham hakiongeza bibi  mwingine mimi siwezi tolerate hii upuzi and these two ladies they should also stop lying to themselves."
q4sWUJxjc4g,It is possible
q4sWUJxjc4g,"@@M26S it is not possible  there is scenerio in the bible where a man named elakanah married two wives one was barren and the other one had children, that is peninah and Hannah but the man alipenda Hannah kushinda peninah.Jacob aslo had two wives Rachel and Leah alipenda Rachel. Solomon had many wives and mpango wa kando lakini kwa hao wote alipenda bathsheba it is not possible my friend."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Thank you for clarification
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Anyway so what happens when Abraham decides to have another side chic,  because he will . Will they bring her home too? Wueh"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I admire this.So lovely.the man is so handsome
q4sWUJxjc4g,"That isn't easy. Co- wife, under the same roof, no. I come from one n can't bear the consequences. One day one time kutalipuka"
q4sWUJxjc4g,If you’re a Christian believer please you can do better than this. Don’t don’t  settle for this
q4sWUJxjc4g,"The Jealousy in me,. Jesus have mercy🙏"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Some of you are here crusyfying Abraham for coming out, yet your husband's have 5 different sides chicks some of which you know about. But because you having nothing to do you're forced to stay in the marriage in the name of goat wives. Immortality is immorality. Abraham is far much better than your cheating husband."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Wow!!, beautiful ❤️"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Abraham took advantage of his first wife very awkward interview Sarah has not healed
q4sWUJxjc4g,"It takes grace to accommodate  another women as your cowife but as long they are happy we'll I wish them all the best👌 ,personally  reke nemwo maah🙆🙆💔"
q4sWUJxjc4g,With all due respect. Sarah is not ok. Body language is betraying you. Even the husband is too much to the second. This is a lie but kila mtu na life yake
q4sWUJxjc4g,"To the haters in this comment section, you too have a choice to either have a second wife or not, so let Abraham and his wives be since it's his own decisions that he made....... Personally I support all of them.......Biko I came in Peace..."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I also don't see a big deal, muslims do this all the time! But the hypocrisy in Christian's! Yet the so called husbands has kids outside marriage."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Kwa kweli  mimi wivu wa  mapenzi umenijaa , mimi  hii   siwezi  kabisa 🙅‍♀️. Serah  amekubali  juu hataki  kumbomoa  ndoa yake.  Na  kama  hakuna  pesa  hii  life   hauwezani nayo  elllloooooo."
q4sWUJxjc4g,Same I can't 😲
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ok …no comments because these things do happen .Reality strikes.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing to be proud of...if the second was the 1st there would be no peace...my opinion
q4sWUJxjc4g,"If God told Abraham to chase away Hagar and her child so he can remain with Sarah then I know God is not for polygamy. 
For Jacob he was given a fake bride that’s why he had two but we all know the agony those women went through to a point each gave their maid to Jacob. 
Otherwise anyone in their right mind should not settle for this. To the women if a man is lying to you that it’s ok RUN RUN 🏃‍♀️ . It’s not ok"
q4sWUJxjc4g,For me this is a NO!
q4sWUJxjc4g,Eish the thought of my hubby waking upfrom another woman  bed on the same house its too much to kill
q4sWUJxjc4g,💯 true it's painful 😣
q4sWUJxjc4g,This is the man
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Last day prophecies  being  fulfilled  we can't  avoid,and in those days seven women will get hold of one man.........."

q4sWUJxjc4g,Hahahahahaha is father Abraham for me
q4sWUJxjc4g,Providing through hard working women
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@veronicamwania9584 I almost thought the same. Especially on him keeping Maureen could be a selfish decision to grow his business because he talks about these women being so enterprising...and Serah is calm as long as her children  are getting the comfort while she sees where it's headed or working her exit plan. That is Sera's marriage wisdom Kwanza before avunje marriage.

q4sWUJxjc4g,"Abraham loved Sarah coz of her cleanliness....the other lady speaks of Sarah's bidii in taking care of her kids ....hhhmmmmm tuseme Sarah anapendewa.........🙃
Sadly Sarah doesn't seem to know her worth...any woman who regards herself highly wouldn't settle for such -so sad this is glorifying sin"
q4sWUJxjc4g,It looks like a situationship . Just my view
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah had no choice....lets be honest
q4sWUJxjc4g,Its all over her face🥺
q4sWUJxjc4g,Second wives are home wreckers.
q4sWUJxjc4g,I wish them all the best but I don't think I can handle this if I was serah.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sure I can't....
q4sWUJxjc4g,"As the saying goes, you’re not married until you’re married (officially). Sex is not marriage. Marry before having sex to avoid unnecessary situations. You can start again purely than settling for such things.otherwise this isn’t supported. This msg is not for everyone though"
q4sWUJxjc4g,You have nailed it mummy❤️❤️
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Truth ,you have said well ,this message actually is for everyone."
q4sWUJxjc4g,"I totally agree,This is so wrong"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bitter truth.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nailed it...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Love wins😘😘
q4sWUJxjc4g,there's nothing to be proud about in this story.
q4sWUJxjc4g,..yeah..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Aren't you proud of father Abraham,dad of many nations 🤣"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Absolutely
q4sWUJxjc4g,Nothing to be proud  but yet u hv the audacity to line up 4 men at a time. Shindwe kabsa
q4sWUJxjc4g,Like nothing
q4sWUJxjc4g,I pity Sarah but God will see her through..and too all husbands like Abraham who take advantage of Good wife out there the wrath of God is waiting..Karma is real and it pays very well..waiting for your story in tuko media doesn't forget.
q4sWUJxjc4g,This guy will regret all this shit
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@polinemiriti4384 atleast separate the houses you can see his love to Maureen by his body gesture but trust me ...utaskia Maureen went with everything.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Jane you're jealous?
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@user-wr9fn4ny4i thank you..
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Serah is a very intelligent  gal ,she might look manipulated but deep down this gal is not stupid!"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Exactly sometimes one has to choose battles. If asked if she would prefer to be the only wife she would say yes
q4sWUJxjc4g,She is not foolish she must be cooking something you can't break en disappoint me like that
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Exactly my thought 
She should lend me her patience"
q4sWUJxjc4g,"True, sometimes you have to play a role of a fool to fool that fool who thinks is fooling you"
q4sWUJxjc4g,But she has agreed to the manipulation
q4sWUJxjc4g,🚮🚮🚮🚮
q4sWUJxjc4g,Serah is a very  intelligent  gal .
q4sWUJxjc4g,TRUE
q4sWUJxjc4g,Now it's about time Christians to introduce polygamy in church. Becouse now they don't shy away with it.they love the world's so much
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Never ever. Marriage is made for one man and woman. Truth be told. For a man to look into another woman, shows disrespect to the wife, it's selfish, the man thinks more of himself. His comfort, his emotions. If the first wife is what he says about her, has 3 kids, what more do you need? If you can't be happy with the first wife, then you have another wife, trust me, a third will come. It's an issue of self gratification for the man. Am not a prophet of doom...lakini...it's not sitting well.....wacha niachie hapo.."
q4sWUJxjc4g,But let’s also not fantasize bondage.  God created one man and one woman. And God has a man for every woman don’t settle for less although it seems comfortable.
q4sWUJxjc4g,..yes...
q4sWUJxjc4g,Theres no comfort in Sarah's eyes
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sera is so beautiful
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Polygamous is an old institution in most  African communities. Nothing special about them. Anyway, wish them all the happiness"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Still tuned in happy new month team Lynn
q4sWUJxjc4g,Ask Abraham kama anataka wa tatu? he's so handsome and beautiful 🥰 ladies
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am I still in Kenya 🤔🤔
q4sWUJxjc4g,The moment polygamy creep in a society its the downfall of that society
q4sWUJxjc4g,Who said so...don't thses men have side chicks already. It might not be for everyone but those who embrace polygamy should not be judged.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Bullshit some of our parents are a result of polygamy.... I live in dubai and guys over here have 3 to 4 wives and the so called society is thriving.
q4sWUJxjc4g,Preach
q4sWUJxjc4g,..exactly Beatrice...all think it is okay...it is not...Only the Holy Spirit of God can reveal to many...oh..
q4sWUJxjc4g,The society is already fallen anyway 😂
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Thax Lynn,may God lead them,"
q4sWUJxjc4g,Am not being judgemental...but the first wife will never be 100% okey ....God never made it that way.
q4sWUJxjc4g,She got a wound that always bleed deep down her heart....
q4sWUJxjc4g,This lady is hurting
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Jkl20120 isn't always easy to accept
q4sWUJxjc4g,@@Jkl20120 the second lady should wait for the third party to come.for her to experience that pain that the first wife felt...
q4sWUJxjc4g,"Following their story, Serah doesn't look like she had a choice but to agree with her husbands way of taking a woman who's from his class  & line of work... We shouldn't Glorify immorality"
q4sWUJxjc4g,pls preach..sarah had no otherwise but this is soo wrong!the guy atajaa mitandao akue famous for the wrong thing😪😪😪
q4sWUJxjc4g,It's true she had no choice
q4sWUJxjc4g,Sarah you're not happy just from the looks.... Never......
q4sWUJxjc4g,"My mothers in-law smile and etc but the animosity? Wueh! And it’s for 50 years plus 
My father in-law says how blessed he is for a happy family 😂😂😂yeah right"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I think that's her nature
q4sWUJxjc4g,"🥵The guy is lying to them ata ataleta watatu..i pity sarah,,the side chick maureen shame on you..sarah had to stay n kuvumilia ulikuja kuharibu ndoa..nkt how do u sleep with 2 women in same house🥲🥲🥲wat r u teaching ur kids???shame shame"
q4sWUJxjc4g,I second you. He is a womanizer deep down inside
q4sWUJxjc4g,He want to show the world's that he's cool no more hanyaring around..a dog is always a dog
